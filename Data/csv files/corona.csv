A bunch of us (various nationalities) were sitting around discussing the news, and one of my fellow indian girls was telling us about a video she saw. A young Pakistani student in China had posted it saying that air India had evacuated the Indian students in his Chinese university and that no one was coming for him. 

There was apparently an overwhelming amount of support from fellow students asking air India to evacuate all students irrespective of race. 

I mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. And the girl said ""Pakistan isn't equipped to deal with this virus. They aren't equipped to deal with a viral fever. They could all die.. and it would be a good thing if they were all wiped out."" 
I have never felt more shocked. 

Irrespective of historical politics between our nations, hoping for an entire country to die out is horrible. This is a global pandemic and the best time to set aside all our biases and support everyone. Everyone has loved ones who we're worried about. We are all susceptible to the virus just as much as every other race.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Latest Indian Innovations and Funding Opportunities to Combat COVID-19,9,fygqpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fygqpd/latest_indian_innovations_and_funding/,0,1586557503.0,"The untapped potential of Indian youngsters is coming to light through various funding opportunities and contests organized by the Government of India. Let us look into some more innovative measures around our country to tackle this COVID-19 scenario.

###### Affordable Diagnostic Kits

[Bione](https://www.bione.in/), a Biotech startup in Bangalore, has designed a kit for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from the comfort of our home. The kit approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research ([ICMR](https://www.icmr.nic.in/)), promises to give the diagnosis result within 5 – 10 minutes.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology ([IIT](http://www.iitd.ac.in/)) Delhi have also come up with a rapid diagnostic kit to detect the virus. The kit developed at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences is currently undergoing clinical trials at the National Institute of Virology ([NIV](http://www.niv.co.in/)) in Pune. Innovations in test kits will bring down the cost of testing and also give results within a short time-frame.

###### Bag-valve masks as Ventilators

Bag-valve masks are hand-held inflatable devices to support breathing in critical conditions. Professors from IIT Hyderabad have come up with a similar design that works with power from an electrical source, such as a car battery. The device is cheap, easy to manufacture and portable.

Professor Murty and Professor V. Eswaran from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad, say,” the device could be manufactured for less than Rs 5,000, or one-hundredth the cost of a conventional machine.”

###### Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)

Vishakhapatnam’s Naval Dockyard personnel have found an innovative solution to meet the demand of ventilators to [treat COVID-19](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/) infected patients. The MOM contains a six-way radial header fitted to one cylinder. This portable innovation can supply oxygen to six patients with one oxygen cylinder. MOM is an effective way to treat patients with limited resources available.

###### Herbal Sanitizers

Washing hands frequently can prevent the spread of COVID-19. All countries are stressing the importance of washing hands to keep ourselves safe from infection. The cost and demand for personal hygiene products have shot up around the country.

Students from IIT-Roorkee have prepared herbal sanitizers to promote personal hygiene. The sanitizers meet the regulations of [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and the US government health research institute (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)).

###### Disinfectant Tunnel

A water treatment company in Tirupur, Tamilnadu has designed a disinfectant tunnel that can disinfect people as we walk through it. This portable tunnel is about 16-feet, made of stainless steel and fitted into a mild steel frame.

###### Arogya Setu and Corona Kavach App

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology have collaborated to develop a COVID-19 exposure risk tracking applications. The beta version of these Apps will be of use to track if the user has any exposure to coronavirus patients. These Apps will track the user’s location and alert them if they come across a person who was tested positive for the virus.

##### Innovation Contests and Funding Events

Several government agencies and private sector companies have come forward to encourage and support innovations and designs developed to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.

###### COVID-19 Solution Challenge

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched this challenge to involve active community participation around the country. The challenge is accepting solutions to help fight COVID-19. The best solutions that could be adopted in real life will be rewarded. The contest will give away prizes totaling to 1,75,000 INR.

The last date to [participate](https://innovate.mygov.in/covid19/) is 16 April 2020.

###### United Against COVID-19-Innovation Challenge

The department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) with Startup India has announced an open call for all companies, startups, and innovators to offer solutions that can bridge the gap between the demand and supply of medical requirements used in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. The contest encourages innovators to work on med-tech, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, to come up with ideas, prototypes, and designs to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for [entries](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/ams-application/challenge.html?applicationId=5e79126ee4b055bfaea9ef66) is 15 April 2020.

###### Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3)

National Innovation Foundation – India (NIF), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology – India has [announced](http://nif.org.in/challenge-covid-19-competition) a competition to find solutions to the most pressing problems in the COVID-19 scenario.

The C3 encourages innovations to reduce virus transmission, improve sanitizing facilities and enhance door delivery options for the elderly. Currently, the contest is accepting entries on a rolling application basis.

###### Centre for Augmenting War with COVID-19 Health Crisis (CAWACH)

The Indian Ministry of Science and Technology has formed the [CAWACH](https://isba.in/cawach/) to identify and support innovations of startups working on the novel, safe and affordable respiratory devices, personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and any other innovation to control and treat the spread of COVID-19. The Centre is equipped with funds amounting to 56 Crore and plans to identify 50 such innovations and take them to the next level.

Many State Governments have also come up with challenges motivating students, startups, innovators around the country to come up with innovative solutions to face this health crisis. The optimistic and encouraging environment is an ideal platform for budding innovators.

>The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.
-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

Moody’s lowers India’s GDP growth forecast to 5.3 per cent in 2020 on coronavirus implications on the economy.,64,fk0dx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fk0dx5/moodys_lowers_indias_gdp_growth_forecast_to_53/,3,1584454884.0," Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday lowered India’s GDP growth forecast for 2020 calendar year to 5.3 per cent, on coronavirus implications on the economy.  

 February projected a 5.4 per cent real GDP growth for India in 2020. This too was a downgrade from 6.6 per cent earlier forecast. 

 “A number of governments and central banks have announced countervailing measures, including fiscal stimulus packages, policy rate cuts and regulatory forbearance; however, the effectiveness of policy easing will be blunted by measures to contain the outbreak, and policy space is constrained for some sovereigns,” 

 Moody’s said oil price shock adds to growth and fiscal pressures for exposed sovereigns. “A period of lower oil prices will further weigh on the economic and fiscal fundamentals of oil exporters, while mitigating the trade shock for importers.”

How Lohono Stays is fighting Covid-19,1,fz4gwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz4gwy/how_lohono_stays_is_fighting_covid19/,0,1586637924.0," These unprecedented times have caused havoc in the functioning of all economies resulting in a standstill. Many households and companies find it difficult to cope with the current lockdown situation. As important as it is to get work turning out, it is more important to ensure the safety and well-being of all our employees. Fortunately, we at Lohono Stays have managed to tackle the challenge caused by this pandemic. Realising the density of the situation soon enough, we were able to proactively apply the work from home policy.

Applying the work from home policy well in time, helped us safeguard the interests of all our team members. However, this was not the smoothest ride. Considering our operations run in over 4 locations across India and South East Asia, we had to ensure that everybody was secure. We ensured that every staff member or villa member staying at our luxury holiday homes received the bare necessities to get through these quarantined times in perfect health. To enhance the productivity of all our team members, our CEO, Mr. Nibhrant Shah personally suggests good articles to read and encourages all to build on their skillset. Our team members are also encouraged to take up online courses, better yet we are setting up online MasterClasses for them. These will help all team members to learn and grow every day.

Our team is constantly working on improving the sanitation and comfort offered at our villas for rent in Goa, luxury villas in Lonavala, Coonoor villas for rent and private villas for rent in Alibaug. We want to be able to immediately get back into action as soon as things are up and running again. We at Lohono Stays, urge everyone to stay safe and stay at home. This battle can only be won by everyone staying indoors.

India's forsaken IT / BPO and other professionals post COVID-19 breakout and Lock-down.,7,fqqi9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fqqi9p/indias_forsaken_it_bpo_and_other_professionals/,0,1585451849.0," As of 5th of March NASSCOM had sought permission from Govt to allow Work from Home [WFH](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/coronavirus-nasscom-urges-govt-to-allow-techies-to-work-from-home/amp_articleshow/74487287.cms) to deal with COVID-19 & permission granted by the 13th of March. Most of the IT companies did start allowing Work from Home (wfh) for a majority of their employees. But some were left out from this under the pretext of essential work for banks such as Wells Fargo. They were forced to work from Office and only after much hue and cry and police raids did they allow the employees to take the desktops home as late as 24th March. This has opened a scope for the spread virus since the virus can still be transmitted amongst employees with out the employee showing any sign.

It has also come to notice that unofficially many employees were threatened of pay cut if they are unable to take the desktops home in spite of 24th Mar lockdown.


The pertinent question arises as to what happens when these employees and their families are found to be infected..? Will they have complete access to health care under company policy? But then, what about their family?

How will they manage their expense if there is mass lay-offs? Given that they are considered too rich to receive ration from govt and too poor to receive grants in the form of bail-outs.

Signs are not encouraging, given that top officials of [corporates](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-25/billionaires-want-people-back-to-work-workers-aren-t-so-sure) (including retired) are not providing encouraging statements (though overseas it will have rippling affect in India) & many companies [like this](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/coronavirus-impact-future-groups-kishore-biyani-in-a-difficult-situation-as-lenders-invoke-shares-report-5070601.html/amp) are already finding excuse of pre-existing loans which signals deferment  of salary pay, for many if not all.

Steps by RBI seems [encouraging](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rbis-3-month-moratorium-on-term-loans-credit-card-dues-emis-included-interest-to-accrue-on-outstanding-portion-of-loan-5080581.html) but it still leaves a gaping hole in the pockets of the professionals.

COVID-19 - Information,1,fm9kmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fm9kmq/covid19_information/,1,1584794800.0,"&#x200B;

These are the collection of data from various resources.

# Corona virus - What it is?

Novel - First time human immunity system is being exposed to this virus

Corona virus - Family of viruses with crown shape

**Symptoms**

Please **monitor your temperature if you have dry cough**. If you get high temperature & any of the mentioned symptoms in point 2, please seek medical advise. In a case, if you have sore throat , please practice social distancing and isolate yourself.

The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and  beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the  incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly  around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become  available.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are

1. **fever, tiredness, and dry  cough** (The AND is important point to note\*\*)\*\*.
2. Some patients may have **aches and pains**, **nasal congestion**, **runny  nose**, **sore throat** or **diarrhea (Apart from mentioned above)**.
3. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
4. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
5. **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease  without needing special treatment**.
6. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
7. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop  serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing  should seek medical attention.

**Spreading**

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose  or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other  people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if  they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

**Asymptomatic Spreading**

&#x200B;

1. If a person is asymptomatic, it is highly that he is not communicating the disease till he follows a good personal hygiene.

The main way the disease spreads is **through respiratory droplets**  expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with  COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the  early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19  from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel  ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of  COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings. 

# How to protect yourself

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

&#x200B;

1. **WASH your hands** : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
2. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from  their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you  can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person  coughing has the disease.
3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?  Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,  hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,  the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
4. Make sure  you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This  means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when  you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?  Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you  protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and  COVID-19.
5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever,  cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in  advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why?  National and local authorities will have the most up to date information  on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.  This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other  infections.
6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19  hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading  widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are  an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
7. Self - isolation period should be 5-14 days.[Guidelines for Home Quarantine](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Guidelinesforhomequarantine.pdf)
8. Please call ahead if you are visiting a doctor.

**Please make sure if you use mask , you know how to handle it. Incorrect handling and using of mask will lead you in troubles (touching front of the mask, not disposing it , touching mask again and again to adjust it)**

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially  coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable  face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after  someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide  shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)).

The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are  to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow  or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from  people who are coughing or sneezing. See  [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information.

Guidelines for home qurantine

## Recommendations for travelers

It is prudent  for travelers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas,  in particular for elderly travelers and people with chronic diseases or  underlying health conditions.

General recommendations for  personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one  meter from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for  all travelers. These include:

* Perform hand hygiene  frequently, particularly after contact with respiratory secretions. Hand  hygiene includes either cleaning hands with soap and water or with an  alcohol-based hand rub. Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred if hands  are not visibly soiled; wash hands with soap and water when they are  visibly soiled;
* Cover your nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or  paper tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing immediately of the  tissue and performing hand hygiene;
* Refrain from touching mouth and nose;
* A  medical mask is not required if exhibiting no symptoms, as there is no  evidence that wearing a mask – of any type – protects non-sick persons.  However, in some cultures, masks may be commonly worn. If masks are to  be worn, it is critical to follow best practices on how to wear, remove  and dispose of them and on hand hygiene after removal (see [Advice on the use of masks](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1269003/retrieve))

As for any travel, travelers are also advised to follow proper food hygiene practices, including [the five keys for food safety](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/en/5keys_en.pdf?ua=1&ua=1), as well as [recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to human in live markets](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

# Actions taken by Gov of India

   * Ministry of Pharma and Consumer Affairs to take necessary action against anyone charging exorbitant price for masks, sanitizers, and other health related logistic material and to facilitate their availability in all hospitals and to people at large. They also directed that people should be sensitized on appropriate use of masks, to be utilized only when needed and to wash hands with soap.

&#x200B;

**8th of March \[**[**https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVIDCabSecLetterGuidelines.pdf**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVIDCabSecLetterGuidelines.pdf)**\]**

I know common logic says that lockdown is helping, but why doesn't the data say so?

One common argument i expect:
Slope would've increased if the lockdown wasn't in place
- this is not true. You can check data for countries without lockdowns and data for india between 7th March to 23rd March, straight line on the log plot is the natural expected graph for the exponential spread of the virus.",Coronavirus

-------------

>The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.
-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

The Tablighi Jamaat’s (TJ) reckless and irresponsible conduct in the current coronavirus outbreak has surprised many within the Muslim community. The Tablighis have largely been an apolitical and disciplined lot with a penchant for holding large conclaves where after-life matters are deliberated and discussed. However, of late, TJ has been witnessing an intense power struggle between its chief Maulana Saad Kandhlawi and a powerful lobby consisting of the ‘shoura’ (executive council).

Saad, a great-grandson of TJ founder Maulana Illyas, reportedly wanted to be one-up on his rivals and ignored saner voices to defer the Delhi-Nizamuddin congregation. Instead, his supporters ensured crowd mobilisation from southern states like Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Kerala, with disastrous consequences. Maulana Saad's role in the TJ headquarters sharing a wall with the Nizamuddin police station has been as dubious. The police reportedly were regular beneficiaries of food and other goodies coming from the TJ office which blurred their vision to act swiftly and decisively.

Explainer: The proposed “zones” idea and why it is a disastrous one.,76,fzus0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzus0u/explainer_the_proposed_zones_idea_and_why_it_is_a/,56,1586717949.0,"The government is apparently floating the idea to create zones of three kinds, red, orange and green. Red zones are hotspots with 15 or more cases, and there will be no activity in them. Orange zones have less than 15 cases and they will have limited public activity, like limited public transport. Green zones have no virus cases where restrictions will be relaxed. (They’ve not yet come out with a full list of relaxed restrictions in this)

My problem is a very obvious one: We are NOT testing enough. Because of this, we don’t actually have a conception of which zones are red, orange or green. That means because of the virus’ 2-week incubation period and the fact that it is asymptomatic means that there will be people roaming around without realising they are infected, causing green zones to also eventually turn orange or red. This would be possible if we had better planning, which we DON’T.",Coronavirus

Anxiety, stress, fear of consequences, loneliness, failure, uncertainty of career, and restlessness, etc are some of the complaints they seek professional solutions to.

He has been receiving calls personally on how to handle the isolation and loneliness and feels that people need to just calm down and engage themselves productively at their homes.

A Gist of Indian Innovation To Combat COVID-19,9,fzjd8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzjd8h/a_gist_of_indian_innovation_to_combat_covid19/,2,1586668738.0,"The contagious COVID-19 outbreak has caused a catastrophic effect around the world. Countries are struggling to control and contain the spread of this disease. India, with its massive population, is making the best efforts to fight against the COVID-19 virus. The 21 day lockdown period has not locked down the creative minds of the researchers and engineers of our country. India supports all forms of innovations in the diagnosis, [treatment](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/), prevention, and spread of COVID-19.

We keep hearing many heart-touching stories of researchers and doctors working to combat this dreadful disease. Here is a gist of what the innovation community of India is up to and how our Government supports them.

##### Innovations across the Country

###### Triple-Layered Anti-infectious Gloves 

About 8.3% of the total cases in Italy are health workers who treat and take care of infected people. A team of Indian youngsters from Viral Brain System have realized the seriousness of this issue and have designed triple-layered gloves that are anti-infectious. The gloves not only protect the user’s hands but also disinfect everything the personal touches while wearing the gloves. These gloves, once opened, can be used for a maximum period of three days. The inner and outer layers of the gloves are made of latex, while the middle layer contains the sanitizer or any disinfecting chemical. The prototype is in testing and can be expected in the market soon.

###### Anti-bacterial Clothing

[Thermaissance](https://thermaissance.com/), a startup from the GTU-incubation center, has come up with specially designed anti-bacterial clothing for hospital staff. The innovation makes use of nano silver-based technology that is capable of destroying both positive and harmful bacteria. This reduces the risk of exposure and spread of diseases among hospital staffs that are in close contact with the COVID-19 infected people. They have also come up with cheap, anti-bacterial masks tested in a NABL accredited laboratory in Mumbai for their authenticity. The masks offer 99% protection from germs even after 60 washes.

###### Colour-changing Mask

A three-layered color-changing mask to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus is at the concept stage of innovation by the [Babaria Institute of Pharmacy](https://bitspharmacy.org/). The mask prevents the entry of Coronavirus and also acts as an indicator when exposed to the virus. The membranous layers of the mask consist of enzymes and chemical reagents that can copy DNA to RNA. When the mask comes in contact with Coronavirus particles, the mask constituents react with the virus and form a solid pink color. The change in color will indicate exposure to the virus.

###### 3-D Printed Toothbrush

The innovation from the startup, Pragratham, addresses the importance of oral hygiene in the survival rate of corona virus-infected persons. This toothbrush is specially designed for COVID-19 patients in ICU. This open-source design requires a 3-D printer and cotton gauze to construct the toothbrush. It takes an hour and 45 minutes to produce a single 3-D printed toothbrush. The product has received positive feedback when tested.

###### The Quarantine Watch App

The senior IAS officer Munish Moudgil with his team in Karnataka has launched India’s first unique mobile app to facilitate active tracking of people in quarantine. The application works on both android and iPhone platforms. The home-quarantined person should download the app, fill in essential personal details, and send selfies. The system will identify good resolution selfies, and officials from the District Photo Verification team will check for the originality of the selfie. The application has also enabled GPS tracking to trace their whereabouts effectively.

###### Online Training Programme

The Karnataka Government has launched a 1.30-2.00 hour training programme to train doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The programme is freely accessible on YouTube. The programme helps doctors to prepare themselves and also teach them on specimen collection and transport, clinical management, and supportive therapy for COVID-19 patients.

###### Sanitization Units

PadCare Labs, a Pune-based startup, has designed a sanitization unit to disinfect the surface area. The unit working on the principle of UV mechanism can disinfect an area of 80 sq ft with a 99.99% bacterial reduction in 15 minutes. The organization will be installing the units in a local hospital soon.

###### C-CAMPs Initiatives

The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms ([C-CAMP](http://www.ccamp.res.in/)) has launched COVID-19 Innovations Deployment Accelerator (CIDA) to identify and support innovations that help in combating Coronavirus. The program has partnered with Social Alpha, United Nations Health Innovation Exchange (UNHIE), India2022 Xynteo, India Health Fund, MedTechConnect, AIC-CCMB, and CCMB to select innovations and develop them to large scale applications. The companies with projects towards the following criteria were nominated for funding.

###### Preventative Measures

[Anabio](https://www.anabio.ie/) Technologies Pvt Ltd works on innovating new preventative technologies that offer better protection than the existing ones. The technology from this company aims to transform a mask or a regular cotton cloth into a protective agent against Coronavirus. This technology will work on meeting the needs of N95 masks and other personal protective equipment.

###### Diagnostics

There is a rising need in India to perform mass-testing to identify and isolate people infected with COVID-19. CoSara Diagnostics Pvt Ltd and Ampligene Diagnostics Pvt Ltd are working on developing easy-to-use, affordable, quick, and accurate diagnostic technologies.

###### Respiratory Devices

5-10% of the Indian population will require ICU in the event of community spread in India. There is a rising need for invasive and non-invasive respirators to treat critically ill patients. US FDA has approved the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines (CPAP) to meet the scarcity of ventilators. Coeo Labs and Avyantra are working on innovations in the mass production of respirators to achieve this scenario.

Many such innovations are going around in the nook and corner of our country to fight back COVID-19. Our Government has also launched several incubation programmes to encourage innovators working on combating this dreadful disease. The active contribution from young [entrepreneurs](https://www.intepat.com/blog/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-rights/) and researchers is inevitable to serve our country during this massive health crisis.",Coronavirus

India to extend lockdown by 2 weeks,15,fz4rsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fz4rsf/india_to_extend_lockdown_by_2_weeks/,2,1586638901.0,"India is set to extend its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks, until April 30, as its confirmed coronavirus caseload continues to soar, with no sign that the severe restrictions on most economic activities have flattened the curve.  India confirmed its highest ever daily number of infections at 1,035 over the past 24 hours, health ministry officials said. This brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus patients to nearly 7,500. Of those, 642 have recovered, and 239 have died.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi engaged in a four-hour dialogue with chief ministers of Indian states on Saturday to discuss whether to lift the lockdown, which has caused extreme hardships to India’s hundreds of millions of casual and informal sector workers, whose incomes have collapsed since the restrictive measures were introduced on March 22.  Mr Modi made no official statement or comment after the meeting concluded. But Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of New Delhi, made it clear that the lockdown would not be lifted on April 14, when it is currently due to expire. Mr Modi is expected to address the nation on Sunday or Monday night about the extension.  Analysts and industries expect that Mr Modi may announce some relaxation of the restrictions for farmers, who are poised to harvest their annual winter wheat crop. Industrial businesses, especially exporters, are also hoping for some relaxation for manufacturers so they can maintain the supply of essential items, and fulfil international orders.  However, all India’s public transportation systems -- including urban metros rails, the railway network, and all domestic and international passenger flights -- are likely to remain suspended.

Latest Indian Innovations and Funding Opportunities to Combat COVID-19,9,fygqpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fygqpd/latest_indian_innovations_and_funding/,0,1586557503.0,"The untapped potential of Indian youngsters is coming to light through various funding opportunities and contests organized by the Government of India. Let us look into some more innovative measures around our country to tackle this COVID-19 scenario.

###### Affordable Diagnostic Kits

[Bione](https://www.bione.in/), a Biotech startup in Bangalore, has designed a kit for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from the comfort of our home. The kit approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research ([ICMR](https://www.icmr.nic.in/)), promises to give the diagnosis result within 5 – 10 minutes.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology ([IIT](http://www.iitd.ac.in/)) Delhi have also come up with a rapid diagnostic kit to detect the virus. The kit developed at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences is currently undergoing clinical trials at the National Institute of Virology ([NIV](http://www.niv.co.in/)) in Pune. Innovations in test kits will bring down the cost of testing and also give results within a short time-frame.

###### Bag-valve masks as Ventilators

Bag-valve masks are hand-held inflatable devices to support breathing in critical conditions. Professors from IIT Hyderabad have come up with a similar design that works with power from an electrical source, such as a car battery. The device is cheap, easy to manufacture and portable.

Professor Murty and Professor V. Eswaran from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad, say,” the device could be manufactured for less than Rs 5,000, or one-hundredth the cost of a conventional machine.”

###### Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)

Vishakhapatnam’s Naval Dockyard personnel have found an innovative solution to meet the demand of ventilators to [treat COVID-19](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/) infected patients. The MOM contains a six-way radial header fitted to one cylinder. This portable innovation can supply oxygen to six patients with one oxygen cylinder. MOM is an effective way to treat patients with limited resources available.

###### Herbal Sanitizers

Washing hands frequently can prevent the spread of COVID-19. All countries are stressing the importance of washing hands to keep ourselves safe from infection. The cost and demand for personal hygiene products have shot up around the country.

Students from IIT-Roorkee have prepared herbal sanitizers to promote personal hygiene. The sanitizers meet the regulations of [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and the US government health research institute (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)).

###### Disinfectant Tunnel

A water treatment company in Tirupur, Tamilnadu has designed a disinfectant tunnel that can disinfect people as we walk through it. This portable tunnel is about 16-feet, made of stainless steel and fitted into a mild steel frame.

###### Arogya Setu and Corona Kavach App

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology have collaborated to develop a COVID-19 exposure risk tracking applications. The beta version of these Apps will be of use to track if the user has any exposure to coronavirus patients. These Apps will track the user’s location and alert them if they come across a person who was tested positive for the virus.

##### Innovation Contests and Funding Events

Several government agencies and private sector companies have come forward to encourage and support innovations and designs developed to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.

###### COVID-19 Solution Challenge

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched this challenge to involve active community participation around the country. The challenge is accepting solutions to help fight COVID-19. The best solutions that could be adopted in real life will be rewarded. The contest will give away prizes totaling to 1,75,000 INR.

The last date to [participate](https://innovate.mygov.in/covid19/) is 16 April 2020.

###### United Against COVID-19-Innovation Challenge

The department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) with Startup India has announced an open call for all companies, startups, and innovators to offer solutions that can bridge the gap between the demand and supply of medical requirements used in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. The contest encourages innovators to work on med-tech, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, to come up with ideas, prototypes, and designs to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for [entries](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/ams-application/challenge.html?applicationId=5e79126ee4b055bfaea9ef66) is 15 April 2020.

###### Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3)

National Innovation Foundation – India (NIF), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology – India has [announced](http://nif.org.in/challenge-covid-19-competition) a competition to find solutions to the most pressing problems in the COVID-19 scenario.

The C3 encourages innovations to reduce virus transmission, improve sanitizing facilities and enhance door delivery options for the elderly. Currently, the contest is accepting entries on a rolling application basis.

###### Centre for Augmenting War with COVID-19 Health Crisis (CAWACH)

The Indian Ministry of Science and Technology has formed the [CAWACH](https://isba.in/cawach/) to identify and support innovations of startups working on the novel, safe and affordable respiratory devices, personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and any other innovation to control and treat the spread of COVID-19. The Centre is equipped with funds amounting to 56 Crore and plans to identify 50 such innovations and take them to the next level.

Many State Governments have also come up with challenges motivating students, startups, innovators around the country to come up with innovative solutions to face this health crisis. The optimistic and encouraging environment is an ideal platform for budding innovators.

What is the Indian govt strategy to end Coronavirus?,0,fwu4ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwu4ad/what_is_the_indian_govt_strategy_to_end/,13,1586327076.0,"I have been reading about it for so many days, but still so confused.

Questions:

\#1: A) Are they trying to cure all infected people of Coronavirus so there is no more ill person or B) they are trying to infect everyone at a slow rate so that no more person is left to infect?

\#2: If the answer to #1 is ""A"", is it even possible, considering it's increasing day by day?

\#3: If the answer to #1 is ""B"", why we introduced lockdown so soon. I think it would have made more sense to introduce lockdown when there were at least 25K patients all over India. Now we have to wait for more time to reach the peak, which means more days of lockdown.

\#4: If the answer is not either ""A"" or ""B"",  then C) what is our current strategy? D) How it will end the Coronavirus? E) Does it require same level of lockdown throughout the country?

\#5: Bonus Question: How are people still getting infected if everyone is locked at home?",Coronavirus

No outrage from this, because the family is not Muslim and they will not be hounded by Media and the establishment. Now, almost everyday we are hearing news about hospitals being made containment zones because of corona outbreak in hospital premises and many doctors and hospital staff getting infected due to lack of PPE kits and proper guidelines, but still neither the media nor the people ask this government why it continues to let this happen. Why doesn't it provide the hospital with PPE kits? Why doesn't it expand the testing criteria?

This virus outbreak is causing a lot of problems for all hospitals. People who don't really require it are hoarding masks and other medicines. This has caused a grave problem as protective masks which you could buy for Rs.2.5 6 months ago are now being sold for ten times their price. This is morally wrong, unethical but sadly it is not illegal in [India](https://indiacorplaw.in/2020/03/price-gouging-in-the-age-of-coronavirus-an-analysis-of-the-regulatory-strategies.html) . This affects the people in the medical field the most as they are the ones who depend on these products the most.

All doctors are risking their lives by treating patients during this pandemic and they get screwed by the public. One day everyone was clapping which was originally planned as a gesture of appreciation for doctors and nurses. The next day we get news about [stone pelting](https://english.jagran.com/india/coronavirus-outbreak-health-officials-attacked-in-indore-during-covid19-patient-tracking-two-injured-watch-10010285) which had happened on doctors .Majority of the people of these country always had a certain hatred for doctors and the current situation would only intensify their hate towards them.

Most medical shops seemed to have closed down but in reality they have hijacked the cost of all the medications to 10-20 times their original price and are selling these essential supplies secretly. This is all really messed up that some people are trying (and succeeding) to profit  off of this.

When there is an acute shortage of PPE, [the government has exported them to Serbia](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/even-as-docs-use-raincoats-india-exports-suits-to-serbia/articleshow/74957518.cms).

Currently, the labs are supposed to test the patients for free and incur the loss as they themselves have to purchase the testing kits. I don't think these people who decided this understand how business/economy works.

I really hope something is done about ALL the things I have talked about. I honestly hope that the problems highlighted above are dealt with. Things are going to get worse before they get better.
