Hi r/india, I have had unprotected at a massage parlor. I don’t know what was going in my head and have been in constant worry since then.

Details : The massage parlor is in noida and they provide 45 mins massage for around Rs 800-1200. I went there yesterday. Had the massage and the masseuse agreed for sex at Rs2500 after much persuasion. I know how that sounds, but i needed it. When time came, she said she had no condom. Neither did I. I asked her if she is infected. She said no. She then asked me if I was. We then proceeded. 

I know that was so risky and foolish. The worry has been eating at me and I haven’t stopped thinking about the potential STDs(mainly HIV). I’ve read online about it and the the chances seem low. But I still can’t put my mind off it.

Someone please provide me with what are  my chances of getting infected. And if some thing can be done this early stage to prevent potential things? Or how my life seems if I am in fact infected.

I need your help here. Anyone, please give me some advice.

Edit: I(23 M) am a student and live in the NCR region. Can’t provide more details due to obvious reasons. I have never had unprotected sex before, not even with my ex. And certainly not going to do it with a stranger in future.

Edit 2: She didn’t look like she did this often and was also inexperienced.

Edit 3: Went to the doctor. He prescribed me darunavir and tenofovir. Took the first dose before 24 hrs from intercourse. Things seem good for now. I’ve learned my lesson and hope this ends here. Let’s see what the future entails.

I've noticed that most of the time, Indians don't write in their native scripts. Whether it's Telugu, Tamil, or Hindi, everyone online seems to resort to typing in a latin version of their alphabet and I'm not sure if it's out of laziness or what.

I think that it's disgraceful to one's language. Japanese people write and type in Japanese, and Koreans write and type in Korean, so why do Indians make it look difficult to write and type in their languages? I personally love most of the Indian languages, each have their own unique and beautiful scripts and I wish I could master one of the languages but then I'm demotivated by the lack of care and use of the Indian scripts.

1550238194.0,3,11,12,"There is a property dispute involving my father and his brother.

My father(eldest) and his brother were born and raised in the ancestral house in Tamil Nadu(Trichy ) and my father migrated to Delhi for his job when he turned 24 in late 1980's. His brother stayed in the same house along with his wife and kid. Since my father was posted this far away, he used to visit his house one in a year, and after his marriage it got reduced to once in two or three years.(late 90's) 

My grandfather did not write any will about the  house and after his death (2000)my father's brother got the house transferred to his name with help of his  lawyers in the year 2001 without informing my father. We are in the process of getting the documents which enabled the transfer of house by the registration office in Trichy.

My father now(2019) retired wanted to permanently move to this home without the knowledge of this cheating done by his brother. He was denied an entry and was asked by his brother to not come to the house as it is his house now. He was humiliated when he seeked help of friends and relatives. My father was heartbroken and did not persue to go by the legal route to get the entry to the house. Whereas I am very much distressed by the way his brother cheated my father and want to how to proceed to solve the matter.Some of the opinions which I got was

1. File a legal case and get the our part of the house. I insisted my father to take this route but he said that he wants peace of mind and don't want to fight it out. (Also his brother's kid is about to get married in coming months).
2. File a criminal case as it was told that it is an ancestral property and what he has done is illegal. I am not sure about the the house being ancestral  as there are records of occupation  up to my grandfather- 3 generations(need to be four generations old). Get the our part of the house and sell it off (quite a good income from sale of the part around upwards of  50 lakhs)

I am very sure that I want to persue the second option but it's getting difficult to convince my dad to agree to it as he says the amount of effort we will put into this will not be worth it. 

Guys what are your opinion on this? How much of the effort will realistically be involved along with the lawyers and court hearings?

1551455025.0,3,30,46,"Hi,

Background: Not originally from Bangalore, but working here for a while and staying near Marathahalli. I don't have any friends (who can teach me bike). I am an introvert with anxiety issues

The fact that I am 25+ (Male) and yet don't know how to ride a bike has been affecting me terribly to the point it is making me anxious (I even dream about it regularly). My social life is fucked up, people at my home, friends, girls somehow have low regard for me because of this

I tried a two wheeler driving school a while back. But thanks to me anxiety, introversion and terrible service of that school, I gave up on the 3rd day. Because of these reasons, I am not comfortable at all with the idea of enrolling in a school where most trainers don't give a fuck and are judgmental

Can any one of you be kind enough to teach me (riding in traffic, uphill, downhill etc) or suggest me a way to find someone who can genuinely (and personally) teach me how to ride a bike? I know how to ride a scooty (but can't ride with a pillion)

I am willing to pay twice or thrice more than what the schools usually charge. The offer of money is to show how important it is me and not to show that I can afford spending large amount

TL; DR, I need someone like an older brother who can teach me how to ride a bike for which I am willing to pay handsomely",t5_2qh1q,Can anyone teach me how to ride a bike in Bangalore?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aw6b93/can_anyone_teach_me_how_to_ride_a_bike_in/

My mom even asked me before buying a house, now I'm worried that whoever I get married to won't be as liberal or broad minded.

Secondly I have had a sheltered upbringing, never had a boyfriend, and I tend to freeze while talking to guys. So this entire concept of marriage is freaking me out. My parents aren't forcing me per se, but I know they have a few proposals in mind.

&gt;  
&gt;So when Mahindra decided to extend the Pininfarina name from car design to car production it brought with it expertise and resources.  Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group, said he wants to take Automobili Pininfarina in the opposite direction and prove that electric cars can be luxurious, exclusive and collectable.  Electric vehicles are the future and Mahindra intends to be in the mass market for shared mobility and autonomous vehicles, he said.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers &amp; sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” &amp; “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",t5_2qh1q,"With the recent Oxfam India Inequality report &amp; Congress' Minimum Income Guarantee announcement, why aren't we discussing AOC's 70% marginal tax in India already?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/alx3kj/with_the_recent_oxfam_india_inequality_report/

The Centre for Communication Governance at NLU Delhi and the Internet Freedom Foundation invites you to attend a spirited discussion on “The Present and Future of Net Neutrality” this Thursday (March 14, 2019) at the India International Centre Annexe (Lecture Room - II).

Why the rager? We know you too have noticed the endless website blockings recently. First, Telegram, then Redditindia, today Alexa.com? Such restricting of access to websites is the most visible form of Net Neutrality violation as we have explained in our previous post. We began tracking violations through our online reporting tool, witnessing continued blocking over the last couple of months currently totalling to 171 reports. This clearly does not seem to be a temporary issue. Take a look at the variety we discovered!  Apart from the actual blockings, our main concern lies in the inability of users to lodge complaints against ISP’s.

Hence, this discussion will be led by experts designed to analyse the existing regulations and obligations on net neutrality. We intend to discuss measurement and enforcement steps to be taken in ensuring enforcement mechanism that monitors, reports and provides users with a well established redressal system to address net neutrality violations. There is need to make sure ""India's got the strongest net neutrality laws"" are not just on paper. We would love for you to come by to brainstorm together! This event is open to the public free of charge (unfortunately, only the Delhi public for now). However, registration is required and we're filling up incredibly fast. Please do register ASAP. See you there!

Agenda

Two panel discussions will take place: Panel I - “Net Neutrality Regulations in India” which will be moderated by Sarvjeet Singh, Executive Director, Centre for Communication Governance at National Law University Delhi.

Panel II -  “The Future of Net Neutrality” which will be moderated by Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Policy Director of Access Now and Co-Chair of the Internet Freedom Foundation.

Remember our post on the secret meeting to the change the IT Rules? Well, after it was no longer a secret due to an Indian Express report, the Government went ahead and announced a public consultation. Yesterday we sent in our comments to them. Read on for the details. These proposed changes can drastically increase online censorship and hurt your privacy. 

# Highlights

* **A private meeting with a proposal to threaten our fundamental rights:** On December 24 2018, the Indian Express [**reported**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/it-act-amendments-data-privacy-freedom-of-speech-fb-twitter-5506572/) that in a private meeting with a few social media companies and industry representatives the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) proposed disturbing changes to an online law that would result in grave censorship and surveillance for Indians. We that very day published the [**full text of these proposed changes**](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/) with an influential analysis that guided public debate.
* **A ""public"" consultation:** Shortly after it MEITY announced a [**public consultation**](http://meity.gov.in/content/comments-suggestions-invited-draft-%E2%80%9C-information-technology-intermediary-guidelines) on the proposed changes. These were proposals to make changes to the liability exemptions for online platform or service provider. An intermediary is any service providers which transmits, hosts and publishes user content. So it can be your ISP, email provider, social media platform, or any web-service which allows you to post, upload and publish. These platforms because of their technical ability to connect us to others, host our data, publish it, help us realise our freedom of speech, they mediate our online experience, impact our privacy and hold great power.
* **Recall these proposed changes, start afresh:** Yesterday we sent [**our submission to MIETY**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pDQt1M81spH66kv0CHcUk8P9U_Dp9_oc/view?usp=sharing) noting the problems with the proposed changes. Our clear demand is that instant consultation with the proposed changes needs to be withdrawn. We fear this exercise is expending energy and resources on the basis of draft legal rules that lack any clear rationale that has been articulated by MEITY. The proposals themselves are substantively harmful to our fundamental rights as we explain in our submissions are unconstitutional. We instead advocate for a fresh exercise with a white paper to update our legal rules. IFF believes that our government should protect people rather than merely seeking greater powers over a few dominant online platforms.

# Analysis

This has to be the most peculiar public consultation we have participated till now. Usually public consultation exercises are done with an approach paper or first trying to understand what specific harms, benefits, or policy objectives we are trying to fulfil. Only after that is done some legal provisions are identified for change or introduction. This is not the case with the consultation on the proposed changes to the Information Technology Intermediary Guidelines Rules, 2011 (the IT Rules). On December 24, 2018 the Indian Express [**put out a report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/it-act-amendments-data-privacy-freedom-of-speech-fb-twitter-5506572/) that revealed some proposed changes were put in a private meeting to a select number of social media platforms and industry bodies.

The same morning [**we published the full text of these proposed changes**](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/). We noted problems early on with these proposed changes on grounds of privacy and free expression giving feedback rule by rule. This was widely covered by the press and became a major news story [**coming shortly after the MHA notification**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ministry-of-home-affairs-delegates-snooping-decryption-hacking-powers-abrogates-responsibility-and-undermine-privacy/). Later in the evening that very day, MIETY [**announced a public consultation**](http://meity.gov.in/content/comments-suggestions-invited-draft-%E2%80%9C-information-technology-intermediary-guidelines) on the same rules. This was without any approach paper or explaining the rationale of the suggested changes. We found this to be not only strange, but also harmful to public confidence as internet users, who will face the impact of these changes the most were de-prioritised where feedback was first sought from large, private online platforms.

We object to the substance of these proposed changes which result in undermining our fundamental rights by turning online private intermediaries into policing agencies by – breaking encryption; empowering the government to gather more personal data; using risky automated filtering; and sending monthly reminders to behave ourselves. We clearly put across our demand to recall these proposed changes and end this consultation. It is not going to lead to any meaningful change or addressing the range of harms which today require a balanced policy conversation which should then move towards legal changes.

This is drawing scarce resources and time in a critical year for our digital freedoms. We need to seriously address issues of online content censorship, privacy, discrimination and due process. The present approach both in process and substance is misguided and even harmful.

[**Our full submission to MEITY can be found here**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pDQt1M81spH66kv0CHcUk8P9U_Dp9_oc)**. Read them! We try really hard to write them in simple, non-lawyerly or policy English.**

I have seen across the web different websites/YouTube channels none of which give Indian Foods at least top 3.  We are below Spain, Japan,china. 

Although these rankings don't hold any strength and are based on personal/experience.
Also each country may think its food is beast but we do deserve more popularity.
We always get moked about us being  street shitter/Customer support. 

I think aleast out food culture deserves a credit. In History it did and we were looted.

On top of my head, our cuisine is

1. Complex and need effort, unlike just putting meat and Tomato between two buns and call it best sandwich.

2. Healthy unlike a pizza with maida.

3. We have the vast diverse cultures and unique flavours.

4. Mouth watering types of sweets and time pass namkeen.

 I do understand each person thinks its own countries food is better/tasty. I'm asking to fight Pancake Vs Dosa, also I'm not fighting against a Pizza. 

What do you guys feel, Do you feel we deserve better?


Edit: Smh, I am aware that each country thinks it is great, they have more varieties and not a about competition.  
Its just the popularity and awareness about the wide range of healthy and tasty dishes we have like.

You peeps out there got to envy my today's breakfast : The [Revenge of the Upma, now with delicious spinach](https://imgur.com/a/gfo7bOW). I hope you all can recognize the vegetables. Onions are not shown in the pictures, but they are **required**.If not, we should meet in person to discuss the food that you eat on your planet; may be could work out some profitable business.

There are some chopped greens and that is spinach/desi palak. This is NOT the same that you get in west. And I hope you are able to recognize those grains as well - Chick peas ( I wonder what happened to that chick), Kidney beans, Pesalu (in telugu), green peas, and kandulu (in telugu). All of the soaked and to some extent germinated. 

Now it's important to cut the ginger into long sticks. Not chopped into small little slices. When you eat upma, you will need to bite that little piece of ginger and enjoy the taste and slight tingling sensation you feel when ginger juice oozes on to your tongue. That juice when mixed with cocktail of other flavors especially tomato is heavenly to experience. Also onions too,they need to be sliced long.

How to cook? Seriously guys, vegetables know how to blend themselves with each other. Your job is to only put them in right order. So here is the order

1. Heat the oil. If it's not mustard oil, I can recommend roasting some fenugreek seeds.
2. Beans+grains. Now that these have been in preparation for a day (coz that's how you get sprouting beans you numbnuts) 
2. Chili + ginger. At least one of the chilli fellow is gonna explode. That's when you move to next step
3.  Palak. Let it cook for ~ 1 min and then add tomato. They both will blend well and signal you with a very very nice aroma. That's when you move on to the next step
4. Add some water just so that all the ingredients are just drowned and about to cry for help but not yet.
5. Bring that water to boil and now is the time to add long sliced onions. Remember onions have to be half cooked. You need them to taste 50% raw and 50% cooked when that gets tangled with long ginger and you take a bite of it.
6. Now add upma rava, keep stirring the brew while you do. It gets cooked under no time. How do you know its' cooked? It gets hard and you can't stir anymore and you stop.

Now serve yourself this wonderful upma along with some child curd.

EDIT:

To the guy who gave me silver, another recipe exclusively for him. No not for any of the other people out there. Without giving me a silver, don't use the following recipe. And [don't cheat](https://imgur.com/frDBIFC) (naughty, naughty!)

I am going out to our farmer's market (రైతు బజారు)  and buy large brinjals. Buy a cooking brush. You cut LARGE slices of brinjal, paint each of the slices with your favorite oil (mine is coconut) and gently place them in non-stick pan and cover it with lid. Now you are going to make a spicy powder that you are going to sprinkle /spread on those cooked brinjal slices

1. Ingredients:  little moong daal (మినప పప్పు), green gram (in telugu it's called pesalu పెసలు ), ground nut, red chillies, slice of dried coconut (**important**, it gives a very distinct flavor). Optional are dhaniya and jeera seeds
2. Dry fry all of the above
3. Now add some salt+ chopped garlic cloves + a ball of tamarind (dry and **important**)  and grind it to a fine powder

Once your brinjals are cooked, sprinkle the above powder and enjoy as a side dish to anything rice.",t5_2qh1q,[Food] Upma is the best food for breakfast.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/alww22/food_upma_is_the_best_food_for_breakfast/

So got a call from Jio, he was trying to persuade me to get the connection and kept mentioning ""how the internet"" &amp; ""entertainment"" will be free for at least 2 years, I told him I'm not interested and hung up the phone.


Not sure how true it's gonna be? But it again will be a dangerous trend for eveyone except Jio if this free service of two years will be an actual thing.

I don't support Jio as I don't want monopoly and want internet to be free &amp; fair for all with no restrictions. Jio just seems stand on the opposite side wrt such views.

TLDR:

&gt;The economist and Ambedkarite scholar Sukhdeo Thorat, and his co-author, US-based sociologist Paul Attewell, posted dummy résumés of candidates in response to advertisements for entry-level jobs in leading newspapers in the country.

&gt;For each vacancy, three résumés were sent. All the résumés were identical in almost all respects (with the same educational qualifications and suitable degrees from reputed universities) but they differed when it came to the caste and religion of the candidate. While caste and creed were not mentioned explicitly in the résumé, in each trio of résumés, one had a distinctly upper-caste surname, one a Dalit surname and one a Muslim surname.

&gt;Thorat and Attewell then analysed the response patterns from firms. Their findings, published in a 2007 Economic and Political Weekly research paper, were striking.

&gt;**The ones with Muslim surnames had the lowest chance of being selected for an interview, followed by those with Dalit surnames. Candidates with upper-caste surnames faced significantly brighter prospects.**

“I get to see very less of sunlight for the most part of the year. Need to rise very early and by 7 a.m I join my abba (father). I help him in making carpets. Our room is very small and it gets difficult for both of us to fit in. Mostly, it remains dark as there is only one window for the light to come in. Carpets are not easy to make. It takes us around 12 hours every day and I hardly get a sense of time. My eyes hurt and the back aches a lot. Sometimes I hear my friends playing outside. I feel such an urge to join them. But it never happens. We are very poor and if I do not make carpets with Abba, we will not be able to have food on our plates. My studies have also stopped. I used to love going to school as I had so my friends there. But had to drop out after the second standard because my parents were not able to afford my education any further.”

**I. STATE OF EDUCATION IN JAMMU &amp; KASHMIR**



**One of the unseen causality of militancy in the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir has been the education sector.** Children are thus one of the most affected cohorts, vulnerable to the impact of these conflicts with breakdown of families and loss of social protection system.



There are innumerable evidences that flag the dire state of education in the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.



**1. The state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir has 6th lowest state-wise literacy rate in India at 68.74% which is 5.30 percentage points below national average at 74.04%.**


[Comparison of Literacy Rates of Top 5 States, BIMARU States, and Jammu &amp; Kashmir (2011 Census)!](https://imgur.com/2albrpG)


Thus, the literacy rate of the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir is not only below national average, but is comparable to literacy rates of BIMARU states.


**2. Net Enrolment Ratio (N.E.R.) has also consistently been below not only the national average but also that of BIMARU states.**


[N.E.R. of BIMARU states and Jammu &amp; Kashmir!](https://imgur.com/DVQtV4e)


**3. The state also fares very poorly on other performance indicators such as percentage of schools having computers or access to electricity.**

**II. WHO ARE WE AND WHAT DO WE DO?**


Child Rights and You commonly abbreviated as CRY (https://www.cry.org), is a non-profit organisation in India, which aims to restore children's rights. CRY works to uplift thousands of underprivileged Indian children denied of basic rights by working across levels - from direct action, advocacy, mobilising public opinion to policy change.

Our Impact:

* We helped set up 13 new schools and facilitated the upgrade of 30 existing schools from primary to higher levels.
* We ensured that 33,000 children were immunized within their 1st year.
* We identified 21,600 children with varying degrees of malnutrition, 7000 among them were identified as severely malnourished (SAM) and were brought under the safety net.

**III. OUR WORK IN JAMMU &amp; KASHMIR AND SUCCESS STORIES**


Currently, the organization has two partners in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, namely - Jammu and Kashmir Association of Social Workers (JKASW) and Koshish that aim towards bettering lives in the districts of Bandipora &amp; Baramulla, and Budgam &amp; Ganderbal respectively. The projects roughly cover a total child population of 16,705 which includes 8,419 males and 8,286 females.


We, with the help of its on-ground partners in the state, runs Child Activity Centers (CACs) that provide a safe space for these kids to play, talk about their fears and issues and express themselves. These centers are meant for never-been to school children, dropouts, children on the verge of being drop out and child labourers. Using light forms of entertainment like music, theatre, drawing and sports, these centers actively work to engage children in various activities, with the aim of restoring some level of normalcy in their lives.


The goal for CRY and CACs is to provide children with the necessary support and motivation and help them get through their tough times.


2 of our Success Stories are:


**1. Sumi Aziz:**


Sumi Aziz, lives in Nagbal village, where accessibility to the basic facilities of living is very meager and the community people have to move to the main town to buy the basic amenities for their day to day living.Sumi never joined school as she was just 1 year old when her mother passed away. Her father and brothers were labourers trying to make ends meet for their family. Her sister also dropped out of school in order to take care of household responsibilities. There was no one in Sumi’s family who could teach her the importance of education and school enrollment.


The CAC representatives identified Sumi as one of the many children who have never been to school. Meetings were conducted to educate the family first, the importance of going to school as well as to motivate Sumi to let her interest rise up in the learning process. The learning from the sessions at the CAC had developed swiftness in her learning interests and very soon she was able to get admitted to a regular school. The CAC representatives have also been actively encouraging Sumi’s elder sister Amina to get involved in the process.


**2. Nighat:**


Nighat had never been to school prior to CRY and Koshish’s intervention. The reason being, the family members being bust with their own work schedule and the school being almost 3 kilometers away from her house. The route to school from Nighat’s house was in the periphery of forest land and was unsafe for a child to go to school alone without any elder accompanying her. CRY and Koshish’s team held various meetings to get the child acquainted with basic forms of education and the fact the CAC center was very close to her home convinced Nighat’s family to opt in for the learning process. A survey was conducted to identify more children in the vicinity and a program was organized to make sure that all the children went to school together thereby eliminating the dependency on family members.

They have tried this for many years. Here you can see people literally arguing with traffic police personnel about how 'They don't need to wear helmets'. Some people literally get aggressive.

Couple of years back I lost a friend in a road accident, He was driving a bike without a helmet, His head was smashed on a divider. I was unable to see his dead body that day. And the look on his parents face when they came to know that our son met with this fate.

I have never skipped wearing helmet from that day, Its like a kill switch for my two wheeler now. 

The traffic police hardly gets anything if you wear a helmet - Its for your own safety, Infact their department earns revenue when they catch you not wearing one. People talk to traffic police personnel when they get caught as if they will be doing a favor on those policemen by wearing helmets.

These people who proudly say that they wont wear helmets no matter how strictly the police enforces the rule, Have these people lost their mind?

Fuck your hair style, If you die you wont have a hairstyle Infact even your kid will have to shave his head. Accidents don't happen announced. Even if you drive properly there is a risk of someone else losing control over his vehicle and crashing into you.

Please wear helmets.

This is my[ second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a6plky/why_is_this_called_ladies_helmet_do_females_have/) on helmets, The reason I keep posting about it is that the images of a dead friend whose head was smashed keep flashing in front of me once in a while

1552333062.0,2,42,108,"Shivshankar Menon is the former NSA during the UPA, and before that foreign secretary, ambassador, etc. and also had a big influence on Indian nuclear posture, India-China relations, etc.

Basically someone really smart and who actually understands what he's talking about and can talk about it without shouting. Anyone, who's been obsessing about the Balakot air strikes (like me) should definitely watch this interview:

[Balakot And After: Assessing Gains And Risks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nX_fU6KGcA)

For TL;WD, he makes the following key points:

1. That the government needed to take this action and it has had major gains. But he says by making it a political theme, the strategic gains have been diminished. The airstrikes went from being an action that **India** undertook to impose costs on Pakistan, to becoming something *Modi* did to win elections. Menon says, the number of terrorists who died, the size of holes on the roofs, etc are totally irrelevant or only useful for political theater, the only measure of success is whether India got the outcome it wanted.

2. He has a negative view of foreign policy under Modi, they have done well with China but lost the initiative with Pakistan.

3. There should be a full spectrum of options, apart from military strikes available to deal with Pakistan including diplomacy, overt strikes, covert action, economic coercion, etc. He also implies in his book that India refrained from overt military action after Mumbai 2008, but used a broad variety of covert means inside Pakistan.

4. India should understand that Pakistan has several constituencies like common people, businessmen, civilian politicians, jihadis/Army, etc and Indian strategy should deal with each differently. Especially because many of these constituencies have aims very different from the Jihadis/Army that actively seek to harm India. By shutting down visas, trade, etc India loses ways to pressure Pak in the future.

5. Most interestingly, he says Pakistan is a strategic distraction and we shouldn't focus too much on them. Our challenges are to become a powerful country and take people out of poverty, create a developed India. He says that even when Pakistan was very successful in exporting terror to India in the 80s and 90s, India still managed to do quite well.

Basically, to treat Pakistan like a mosquito, punish it when needed but not waste too much effort on it. He also questions the entire thing about getting Masood Azhar on the UN list because it's a waste of time and energy and achieves nothing.


What I really love about this guy is that he doesn't think of short term politics and only what India (which is not Modi) should do and the direction it should take.

Interestingly, based on a reference in his book, I looked up [an interview with Manmohan Singh in 2004](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/24/opinion/IHT-indias-new-leader-singh-talks-of-peace-and-a-war-on-poverty.html), one week after he became the Prime Minister, and there you can see the strategy India followed for the next 10 years.",t5_2qh1q,Finally some intelligent discussion of Balakot air strike by former NSA Shivshankar Menon,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azxp53/finally_some_intelligent_discussion_of_balakot/

On the first day whilst going out, we were stopped by cops and told it's illegal to drive a white board taxi. He harrassed us and didn't let us go further. Threatened us that we might have been driving a stolen vehicle and could press charges. Made us call the dealer soon, and spoke to him. Following which he took 500 rupees from us and let us go. 

&gt; We didn't know it was illegal to rent the white board taxi; the dealer never told us.

&gt; We couldn't fight with the dealer knowing he had our original IDs.

Had to give back the car, pay for the days and loose precious time of the trip. Got another yellow board vehicle the next day. 

&gt;Today, spoke to a friend who had been there. And said he'd been through the same hassle. Every single detail was similar. Makes me realise this probably was an inside job, with the cop having a setting with the car dealer.

1552670220.0,2,57,62,"That person is me and i am standing here all alone. 

I will be 29 in some months and i am the elder son of my family. My father just retired and slowly the responsibilities will come on to my shoulders. If you have something you could tell me , and decide to read further, know that once i do the act, during that time i would be showering all my love for you. I have lost all hope of having a life and being a burden on this world.
 
* I was a good student in school,in fact i was in the top,had some good programming skills then or i am not sure - it might be mugging up the whole programs and dump it out in the final exam. I even got a medal from my school with scoring 100/100 in computer science. You will see the irony of this later.

* Fucked up my 12th in science because i was homesick and had a tough time living in a hostel and because i was weak at maths. Now at this age, if you ask me some calculus which people do remember at my age - i do not. Not even 1 %. What that tells you about me?

* Prepared for medical entrance for a year paid by my father's hard earned money. Nothing came out of it. I was halfway into it and halfway hoping as if luck would be showered upon me and i would get through the entrance. But reality struck hard.

* Did Engineering in Instrumentation technology (a core stream ) from a good private college with good cgpa like around 8.5/10. But you know how i got it- i got through initial  1st 3 years studying and giving it somehow but the 4th year was tough for me- i cheated in the exams for almost all the subjects with chits and chits of paper i wrote in a minutes. 
I cheated through the exaams because i knew it was too tough for me to actually make sense of the subjects and i was afraid i might not even pass.

But all this was of no use anyway- that degree is just a certificate in a file now and is not worth a rupee now because on paper i am so and so engineer but in real life, i am a loser who has actually forgotten almost all of which i studied in those years. I guarantee that people are there who still know the fundamentals of a subject and can even give the exams after many years in engineering but i was not. My memory failed me or i caused my memory to fail - in any case i cannot remember anything of that Btech.

* Got placed in IT starting with the a company starting with the letter I - you know which one- in spite of having no spectacular programming skills and because it was not Xth std Comp Science which i had a false notion that i will be good at it and thus i chose to go with the company. 

* During the training period itself, i came to know that its too hard for me to do any actual programming. Passed after failing and giving a retest with literally some help from other kind trainees. Still i stayed there. I never left because you see on paper, i had passed but in reality i had failed.

* Got posted in Mangalore, lived there alone in a 1 RK.

* Wasted 4 years there, literally wasted in a support project where due to my inability, which may be they saw through me or just randomly , i was handed the L1 part-doing triage of the issues , and open a ticket, write a select query in Teradata, give that information to the client. Just that. Why nothing more ? Because i was too dumb to actually code or solve a real problem.

* Transferred to Bhubaneswar nearby to my home last year - just for the sake of it. I am still in the company, was on bench for almost a year and could not get project because i had no skills.
But they did not kick me out or neither i voluntarily did that.

* I am in a project right now which i got at the end of the year where they use TM1, Cognos, INFORMATICA, Unix, DB2. I literally don't know any of the technologies. Searching here and there, getting called by the leads as dumb, doing the least basic task which the lead has to explain to me - this is my life now.
On top of that , i keep on forgetting things which the lead would have told me the last week. 

I do not even understand the code other people have written in the existing systems, i do not understand how they would come up with such complex logic.

* I have lost the ability or may be never had logical reasoning skills which is needed to do programming - be it any language. I don't have the ability to think of a solution to any programming requirement, do not have the skill to divide the problem into blocks and solve it 1 by1. This is not Xth class stuff - this is the real world.
I have even lost the ability to even think of something to approach the problem.

This is my wasteful life. You know what i do instead of trying to improve - i indulge in viewing tv shows, podcasts,youtube anything to just pass time and not do something constructive.

I am a listless person with no energy to face the world. I do not have any skills to even get a different job. By the age of 29, people more or less figure how to earn for their family but i have still not figured out - nor i have the energy to think of it. 

**What is the point of living such a life ?**

I have procastinated, i have wasted my years when people try to make something out of themselves and people i know who were once below me in skills have gone on to try, struggle and are succeeding in their lives. But i did not.

Why should i exist when i am the burden on my world now (my father and mother although they are trying to help me but they cannot because i have reached the end) ? 

I am a wasteful, pathetic loser in life now.I do not even an ounce of energy to solve my problems. I somehow think if i take out myself out of the equation of lives of my family and they somehow forget that i ever existed, it will be great. I have no friends now as well.

I do not blame anyone for the condition i am in right now, it was me and me only. In spite of knowing that i am wasting time and instead of doing something constructive - anything, i indulge in viewing shows/songs/podcasts just to fill that time and get that moment of fleeting happiness.

Now dear reader, if you have read this far of my wasteful life i have lived, what will you tell me? That there is still hope - but i know there isn't. That somehow you will come out of it - but i know this will never happen.

Why should i not jump out of this balcony i am standing now and end this constant misery i am in? 

Why?

The fabric of life has been torn. There is no structure or order in it but just chaos all around. Life is miserable when everyone around you is doing so well in their life and career and you are going nowhere. You don't have much parental or siblings support, no friends close enough to bare your hearts to and frequently cry yourself to sleep wondering if anyone will really care if you are gone. You try and post online in vain hoping someone will hear but deep down you know that people have enough shit in their life already and can't truly help you. It is you who will have to eventually pull yourself out of this hole but you just can't find the strength to do it.

So you just lie in your bed hoping that if you don't find enough strength to get out of the hole, you someday find some to dig deeper and just end it all.

These packages cost a lot so I thought instead of selling them I'd help a fellow student out.

If you're going to start preparing for JEE or are going to start your 12 or 11th, live in Delhi or Ghaziabad or Noida. I'd be happy to help you! 

I'm currently out of station so I can't give them to you until I'm back. My apologies.

Anyway! 

I'll be selecting someone from the comments in a few days. Give me a reason why you need it. We'll discuss and I can give them to you!

In that timeframe I've taken him to several thanksgiving dinners, introduced him to my family etc. He however refuses to even acknowledge I exist to his parents. I've asked him before and he's basically told me they wouldn't like him marrying a white girl since they think they're not loyal and I don't speak their language. I love him and we're basically at the point of getting married but his lack of courage is the only thing stopping us. I've told him that he could try convincing them by telling them that I went to the same top tier college as him and the fact that I've stayed with him for over 10 years to sway them but he doesn't seem to try.

&amp;#x200B;

There isn't an optional class or training I can pay for to know about how to invest money and this is making us work like donkeys and yet ending up with little money. Sadly, even years after I started earning I never knew about savings. All I was told is, if you have excess money ""FD karlo"" and put some amount of money in RD. These were the people who play safe and who don't want to take even a small risk. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then come the other relatives, the businessmen. ""Beta shares mein laga do"". I was curious to explore this option as I could see that they were doing pretty well for themselves and boasted great returns. When I asked them for financial advice, they told me to go to [moneycontrol.com](https://moneycontrol.com), look at some shares and their 1/2/3 year growth chart and then invest. They suggested some small company of which they don't know ANYTHING, but they've huge money there because ""aage yeh bohot badi company ban jayegi, iska scope hai"". And somehow, these people aren't losing money.

&amp;#x200B;

I nope'd the fuck out. Then there was a tug of war between people who advised me to put my money in debt instruments and people who advised me to put my money in the market. As if being the rope in this tug of war wasn't enough, one other party came! ""Beta, real estate mein laga do"". They want me to invest in a land in a state that I have never been to because ""it is going to be a smart city"". I will probably never visit that state, but they're telling me that they know someone who has invested in land there and the price has already appreciated by 30% in less than an year without progress being done in the city.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe, if there was a single centralised source that could teach some financial literacy to people, I think we could make money make money and retire a little earlier instead of slogging. ;\_;

Is there anyway to stop this auto deduction from taking place? As I understand, the outgoing gets barred first and then after a few days, the incoming gets disabled as well.

Now I've been on the phone with Jet for the last 30 minutes trying to figure this out (45 min wait time ftw)

1552925137.0,1,32,56,"Hi,

So this particularly applies in India since you can buy once cigarette at a time instead of a pack.

I used to smoke about 6-8 cigs a day, and work out maybe twice a week halfheartedly. The new sense of motivation that I began using is as follows:

**Reward yourself with *one* cigarette after your workout. Plan to not buy cigarette packs and plan your day so you sort of look forward to that one cigarette after you work out**

Now this may seem strange(especially to people who do not smoke), and if you don't smoke, then that's great! But for those who do, this is especially helpful,

* I don't feel the need to have a cigarette when I'm stressed because I know that I would earn one once I work out later in the day.

* If I skip working out, well tough for me. I don't deserve a smoke today.

* If I'm overly exhausted and want a cigarette, well, I need to work out to deserve one. 

This is almost entirely placebo, and it works very well for me. It might work for someone else too. I went from 6-8 cigarettes a day to 3-4 when I first began this ""routine"" and then to 2 cigarettes and I'm very very proud to say that today was the first day after two months that I came back home without wanting to smoke. It feels great to be bringing myself to actually do this.

____________

**Some tips:**

* Don't smoke before your workout. If you work in the day, it would tire you out very quickly. If you are unable to control and do smoke, have a chewing gum afterwards or some form of mild sugar to ease up the nicotine levels.

* If you're taking pre-workout/caffeine/creatine/modafinil, it doesn't affect you too badly. Just again, try to not smoke before the workout. When I've done both, I've had a mad urge to poop before working out.

* Dehydration and heat loss: Its possible to be dehydrated right after you take a smoke so keep that into account and don't overexert especially in the beginning. If you just finished a workout and are going from a warm gym to a cool sky after, make sure you're well clothed because the nicotine can fuck you up if you're not well covered.

**Take nothing that I say, or anyone says as a given** I'm not a medical professional, and I am not trained to give out advice. This is what worked for me. I hope you're able to give up smoking and/or get that workout yourself too!",t5_2qh1q,"[LPT] If you are a smoker, and wish to go work out, but have a problem with motivation on fixing both things, I have a trick that works for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b2khff/lpt_if_you_are_a_smoker_and_wish_to_go_work_out/

1550766961.0,1,31,78,"I want to let you know about one of my intimate friends who is a soldier of the Indian army. I'll hide most details to protect his identity and also for national security.

He was a good student in the school level. However, his family fell in financial trouble due to the premature demise of his father, the only earning member. So, he decided to join the army after completing 10+2 in PCM.

He was recruited as a soldier in the technical branch of artillery. Now, he has 10+ years of experience in the army and the rank of an NCO.

He was posted in various parts of the country including Kashmir and the infamous Siachen. His main roll in the artillery is to calculate the trajectory of a shell fired from a gun (canon).

He is a cool guy and a real gentleman. I have heard many stories from him which I unfortunately can't publish here.

He was in vacation during the Kashmir terrorist attack. So, his leave has been cancelled and he was called back to duty.

He is a soldier and ready to give his life for the nation. However, he is not fond of war and bloodshed.

Bless him if you can. Jai Hind.

Edit: Thank you all for showering love and encourage for my friend. So, I'll add some more facts about him.

He is married and is a proud father of a baby girl. He loves his Royal Enfield bike and also to chill with friends.

Last year he completed a bike tour of about 2000 KM alone with his RE (Punjab to Bengal).

He is trying to complete his graduation from IGNOU but it seems difficult for him to appear in all the exams. He wants to open a business after retiring form the army.",t5_2qh1q,My friend is a soldier,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/at56gs/my_friend_is_a_soldier/
1549206125.0,1,12,0,"We Indians take a perverse sense of patriotism by bashing PewDiePie and supporting the 'Bollywood' media conglomerate, T-Series. No doubt, as an approximation of retribution for the almost 200 years long British Raj. Our people also don't shy away from the racist slurs we could imagine.

From creepy online predators (the friends of Mr Bob Vegana who like lasagna a lot) to scammers (IRS/Tech support just search on YouTube) we do have our fair share of weirdos.
PewDiePie and the whole world mostly knows us by our online avatar plus 'bollywood' (what a tragically pathetic name!) shenanigans. Which doesn't give an outside viewer the right idea of our nation.

Sure, PewDiePie is a troll (although he doesn't go all out nowadays unlike his alleged Nazi Sympathising jokes in the past) and our brothers and sisters simply took the bait resulting into a unity that the nation has seen on rare occasions. What does it result into? Chunks of profit to all parties involved, PewDiePie, T-Series and YouTube (the platform has seen more users engaged and hence monetisation heaven.)

There is a silver lining to this. If you consider the massive support both parties have been able to garner, we could (in theory) use that level of international syndication to our advantage. Imagine such a large force of driven people striving to spread awareness about important issues. Cancer, science literacy, international human rights threats, or (my favourite) coming up with a better system of governance by which we may improve our lives along with ensuring that the future survives.

1550788561.0,4,4,3,"Next to Aadhaar, Facebook may be the greatest modern threat against privacy. How do we fight back and keep Facebook from colonising India?

&gt; ""The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)""

Have you noticed? Whenever someone says ""you're being **too political**"", it usually means ""you've mentioned a group of people I don't care about"".

Or **they gaslight you** -- saying you're ""crazy"" for not being white, male, straight, or ""American"" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined ""moral purity"".

**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley's social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. ""Them"" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.

# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**

This is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt ""free speech"". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like ""diversity is the problem"", ""don't shove _your diversity_ in my face"". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.

&gt; Here's an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it's ""just science"" and ""knowledge wants to be free""? Of course not.
&gt; 
&gt; Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it's ""just speech"" and ""information wants to be free""? Of course not.

Now you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about ""free speech"". It's free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.

In other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn't like them. And as you'll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.

---

## **Aadhaar's Failure is Facebook's Success**

The question here begins with privacy.

Aadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India's citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.

In the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That's why Facebook is ""free"". It's as if Aadhaar's privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook's business plan.

For India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government's dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.

# **Facebook's Plan to Colonise India**

Starting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, ""if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we'll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost.""

Thankfully, India's regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.

## **Facebook and Bollywood**

If you've watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you'll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it's not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.

The two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.

Again in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook's messaging service (WhatsApp).

Even though Facebook's attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.

Instead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.

You may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you've seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone's smartphone. (There's even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))

# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**

Now think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).

As more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).

# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**

So how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?

We now know that [""free"" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don't care.

There needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they'd better not be too ""political"". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.

I'm working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I'd be glad to work with you, too. And if you're just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it's okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.",t5_2qh1q,"Digital Colonisation: the fight for India's soul, and for the rest of the world, begins with individual privacy online.

I think whatsapp needs a corporate sharing capability of some sort. Similar to Snapchat sending messages on holidays and birthdays. That's the only way they can educate their users on 1) how to figure out fake stories vs real news and 2) how to prevent scams. 

Maybe some sort of message reporting feature would be nice. So if a fake forward is going around the country, people can report it as fake and then whatsapp will tag the message as ""might be spam"" or something like that. Or maybe a bot can run to check when a picture or block of text is shared to show when the image was first shared. 

Now of course end-to-end encryption is a hastle in this. So maybe there's an option where you can select a message ""Fact Check"" it. So it'll simply copy-paste the text to google or reverse image search which will most probably open up a news source debunking or proving it.

I am starting a salary sharing thread for people based in the tech industry. I think this will help us all in knowing what the industry standard for a particular position is and if we are getting underpaid at our current job. **The bottom line is to negotiate for higher salaries based on the industry  standard**

---

**Post in the following format:**

* Name of the Company:

* Job Title or Position:

* Years of Experience (0 for intern): 

* Field or Department: 

* Base Salary:

* Bonus (if any):

------

1. Do not fill out company name if you're from a small company e.g. 75 people or less. This is to prevent doxxing. This was included for entrants of bigger tech companies.

2. If you are based out of India, than **do not** convert the figure to INR

If 'hum dekhenge' is anti-hindu how do the right wingers expect people to chant Bharatmata and Vande Mataram and Jai Shri Ram to prove their Indianness. The whole thing is based on Hindu religious traditions and iconography and if we check the history of these chants, these utterings were used to create a strong Hindu identity among the masses during the anti colonial struggle. It is perfectly understandable that if believers of non Hindu traditions find it problematic to visualize the national as a benevolent mother goddess whose children are Indians, but then almost all BJP supporters expects everyone to chant these to prove their loyalty and secularism.

Every single state or central government funded institute is starving and has been receiving cutbacks left and right and in the mean time, these fucking assholes are literally planning to develop entire privately owned townships to make more money.

Should all political parties be forced to pay 30% of their donation revenue to the Central and State government respectively? The split would be 15-15, where there would be a sharing pool between all states and the money would be distributed according to the population distribution ratios in those respective states.

I mean, afterall these guys are doing this for their country right? So they shouldn't have a problem with strengthening the economical backbone of their dying country by these donations.

I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.


###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM

A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 

Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.

>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.

>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).

>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?

>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.

>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!

So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies. 


###Dilip Ghosh, BJP

Obviously he comes from the Genocidal, Muslim hating, Hindutva thumping party known as BJP. But he is THE WORST BJP leader, worse than Modi and Amit Shah. Why do i say that? Lets take a look at the articles:

Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata, get yourselves checked.   

###Mamata Banerjee, TMC

I will again quote the comment above by u/pro_crasSn8r, but i will add some stuffs of my own too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing

>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.

She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.

Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 

>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.

>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.

>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.

>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.

​

>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.

>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.

​

>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.

>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!

NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.

Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.

As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.


###PS: What i left out.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 

Its called Syndicate.

In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.

After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.

Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]

Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.

Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",,"Since some people actually believe Mamata is worse than Modi, lets's see how she compares to the other CM candidates from the other parties of the state.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g44szk/since_some_people_actually_believe_mamata_is/

A young Pakistani student in China had posted it saying that air India had evacuated the Indian students in his Chinese university and that no one was coming for him. 

There was apparently an overwhelming amount of support from fellow students asking air India to evacuate all students irrespective of race. 

I mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. And the girl said ""Pakistan isn't equipped to deal with this virus. They aren't equipped to deal with a viral fever. They could all die.. and it would be a good thing if they were all wiped out."" 
I have never felt more shocked. 

Irrespective of historical politics between our nations, hoping for an entire country to die out is horrible. This is a global pandemic and the best time to set aside all our biases and support everyone. Everyone has loved ones who we're worried about. We are all susceptible to the virus just as much as every other race.

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Generally, we have found that entrepreneurs are very knowledgable about their particular business, but they’re very shallow in their knowledge about business practices that help drive value and efficiency.” – John McNamara

1440193031.0,6,98,33,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki.

1495392083.0,6,49,59,"My dad is 52 years old. His family was one of the wealthiest business class family when he was young. But due to the unstable income in business, he decided to pursue Engineering. He loved Engineering, but his parents did not. They were okay with him doing engineering, but didn't give him any luxury that his brothers who took over my grandparent's business. He started working since he was 18 and only got enough money for fees and food from family. 

I am telling you this because my dad learnt very early in his life that he had to work hard to earn a good life for himself and his family. He comes from a Tier 2 city where (at that time) business and bank jobs dominated the market with very less value to engineers. He worked for a salary equivalent to 2,000 / Month at first. He was okay with this because he had a house to live (joint family) and his food was taken care of at home. After a point, my uncles started humiliating him because they earnt way more than he did and neither of them had even passed 10th.

This made my dad move to Bangalore when he was 28 and he worked as person who'd repair electronics. From there, he has come here. Today he is the MD of an MNC. I feel bad seeing the way he works. He leaves to work at 7:30 and comes home at 2AM Monday to Friday.

He has taken only 3 weeks off in the past 3 years, but spent that time working from home instead. He works even on weekends. I logged into his Facebook yesterday and all his colleagues have a good personal life. My dad, OTOH, is doing 3 people's jobs and he is okay with it.


Even though he enjoys it, it is going to take a toll on his health. He is not into sports or doesn't participate in social gatherings that much too. How can I give him a good personal life? Be it video games, TV shows or anything. I want to make the weekends peaceful for him. Please help.",,Want to give my dad a life apart from work. What can I do?

Some channels like **NHK Japan is being offered for free on my connection, but on others it's like 1800 rupees**...so I'm also confused **whether channels have different prices as per the service provider**.

1548078786.0,10,17,25,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",,"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/

[Previous threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search/?q=Weekly%20mental%20health%20support%20thread&restrict_sr=1&sort=new)",,"Weekly mental health support thread - December 15, 2019",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eatv2c/weekly_mental_health_support_thread_december_15/
1375712879.0,10,184,37,"Hello /r/india,

I feel we got off on the wrong foot here. I can narrate the series of events which led to this miscommunication but it’ll be in vain. Over the past week we realized that there is a major communication gap between the users and certain moderation initiatives we have under taken. To be precise I am talking about the ‘comment score hiding’ feature test initiated by mod /u/rahulthewall 2 days ago. The feature was introduced to the mods by reddit admins a couple of months ago and since then a lot of communities have tested and implemented it successfully. We realize that there are a number of new users in /r/india and reddit in general who do not understand what this feature means or what it is supposed to achieve. In fact a lot of old users also seem to be either confused about its utility or are against it for their own valid reasons.

I would recommend that the community read the following links to know more about this feature and then discuss its relevance in /r/india in the comments of this thread.

• **[Voting on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting)** 


• **What is comment score hiding?** : Minutes to hide comment scores is a subreddit setting accessible to moderators of a subreddit. If set, comments in the subreddit will have their score hidden for the specified number of minutes, after which the score will appear as normal. For example, if set to ""60"", any comments less than an hour old will not show their score. Voting still behaves normally, and behavior of the page will not otherwise be affected (best/top sorting will still use the scores, comments with score less than the user's threshold will be collapsed, etc.), but the comment's actual score will not be visible until it is at least that many minutes old. [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/)

• **Goal**: The goal of this feature is to try to reduce the initial bandwagon/snowball voting, where if a comment gets a few initial downvotes it often continues going negative, or vice versa. By hiding the score for a while after posting, the bias of seeing how other people voted on the comment should be greatly reduced.

Some other notes about how this feature works:
 - The maximum for the setting is 1440 minutes (24 hours). 
- Scores will remain visible to moderators (and admins). 
- Scores will also be hidden for RES users, mobile users, etc. (will display as the comment having the default 1 point in mobile clients)

* /r/india on Comment score hiding: [2 DAY OLD POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jjx0b/to_the_mods_of_rindia_about_hidden_scores/) | [3 MONTH OLD POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1dew7v/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/)

• **General Reddit Feedback**: The community opinion is largely divided about this feature, but many subs have found it extremely useful. [Further Reading](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1e0dyz/moderators_general_feedbackfollowup_for_the_new/) 

Some users have reacted more negatively than others and accused the moderators of being on some sort of a power trip. Please be assured that every action we take here is to make the community better. We spend all day keeping your subreddit free of a variety of innovative spam, shameless self promotion, page-view mongers, porn among others things. We make sure that your real identities are secure and that no one incites a witch hunt against another user and that things never escalate to a level where the subreddit gets banned or hot listed. If you ever have any questions or need clarifications (heck we’ve even answered questions about comment formatting) about any aspect of /r/india then please feel free to write to us on [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia). Our response time is pretty quick usually; those of you who have written to us or who write to us regularly can vouch for it.

**Next step**:

• It is our suggestion that the feature be kept active for another 5 days to complete at least a week of testing. (The ideal testing time is usually 2 weeks)

• The poll will be active for the entire duration of the test and we will announce results at the end of the week.

• This is the Official Community discussion thread on the ‘comment score hiding feature’. Please put your point across in a civil manner, use your vote wisely and don’t downvote just because you disagree.

• **[Take the doodle poll](http://doodle.com/yzqqd5fyh87kktpn), and register your official vote.**

It is my suggestion to the moderation team to keep their interaction on this thread to a minimal [except answering questions directed at us]. The community has heard from us; let’s hear what the readers have to say. I encourage /r/Indians to upvote this thread for maximum visibility and use their votes and comments in a civil manner without getting into rage fights with other users.

Every 3 days, a new subreddit would be linked in this post.

This would be on a daily basis for the communities listed in our Wiki in the given order [Except for the Weekend State of the Week Thread].

So if you find that we are missing out on some communities in the wiki section which are related to India, do contact us over mod mail to include it.

Also, the mods of the respective communities can give us a shout out in the mod mail, if they want to add any brief description of what the community is about.

1.  Interest free loans to all, No bank fees
2.  Could ethically be appealing to the Poorest Sections of India -         Muslim
