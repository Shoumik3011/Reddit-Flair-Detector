1548930960.0,3,3,3,"I was planning a trip to Delhi and had booked a rail ticket next week. Lived here, mostly want to go take a break and roam around while the winter lasts. I also plan to take a trip to a nearby hill station, and had booked looking at the week in which there would be less chance of rain. I had thought Mussorie as the weather indicated sunny and I could access office guest house. Anyway the temp seems under zero, there is news of snow in few areas, and now the weather shows slight rain in 2 days.

So I just want to know if I should go now, delay 2 week or a month, or choose another place from Delhi? My criteria basically is to have a high chance of comfortable trip, and have less fog at least in daytime. I think because the humidity shouldn't be that high, in sunny days the fog should be low but not sure.  I had gone to Ooty a month ago and it had too much fog though.

1548442534.0,3,2,2,"Hi [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india), I'm a PG engineering student (cse). I don't know exactly how to explain my problem, I hope people from [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india)will not make fun of it and will provide some really helpful replies. All my life I have studied in top institutes of this country(earlier due to my intelligence and later due to my reserved category). From the past few years, I have become a (below) average student in life(since my class 9). Things are getting deteriorated from then. I find difficult solving higher secondary maths and don't know any calculus/derivatives. But still I got admission in top college due to my category. Now that I m in PG, when I study logic/any maths related stuff in cse, I find it extremely difficult to understand abstract concepts of it due to my weak knowledge of maths and logic. Problem is not just I don't know fundamental maths, problem is my mind has become dumb from last many years that it has lost its logical/abstract conceptual building capacity. Due to this I scored average GPA in UG. I have to study for much more time compared to my classmates, still I score way less than them(some of them study like a day/night before for exams yet score better). Even now, when the teacher explain some concept in class, my mind gets lost easily but when I focus I do understand some logical concepts(eg. tableau method logic) but I can only solve those questions on which I practices before; unable to do some other/slightly higher difficult questions which require logical solving power.

Sometimes, I want to die because I'm unable to cope up with studies/life/career(as I can't go back in time to study 9-12 maths again). Tried for govt job like ssc cgl but was eliminated from tier 2 because of low marks in maths.

I want to change my life and break this path of deterioration. I want to build again the conceptual/logical ability of my mind and re-work on my maths skill(at least those concepts which would be helpful for me in current course). Also, I am not street-smart which works as a double-negative for me.

What can I do to recover my long lost mind power and utilize it to develop? I don't do any meditation/exercise, will meditation help me focus better in class or study? Please help me!

P.S.- I am disabled person, hence unable to do excessive exercises(running) or go out seeking professional help. Also, I do watch porn and fantasize it a lot (another bad habit I want to get rid of, as many times, I fantasize it in class with teacher which lost my focus in lecture).

Right now my first trip will likely be to the more touristy spots, Rajasthan primarily with another state nearby, still undecided but probably Uttar Pradesh. 

For my second trip I'm really interested in visiting the northeast of India, near Myanmar as I'm planning to travel through Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar before heading to India. I know for sure that I want to visit Sikkim because of the beautiful mountains and monasteries. Based off how small the states are in the northeast it's possible I could get to see 2 more states in the region (trying to stick to specific states to explore them in as much depth as possible). So my question is are there any 'no go' zones in the northeast primarily? What's the situation in Arunachal Pradesh? As far as I'm aware it's a disputed area (may be a touchy subject here...) and I know China and India don't have great relations and with the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar I was wondering if there's any conflicts going on in the states bordering Myanmar? I'd also love some suggestions on your favorite spots/states in the northeast!

i think my father might be having an affair.


i am 24 years old. my parents have been married for the same period now. 

i have caught my father several times now. not face to face but indirectly.
one time i saw an old feature phone like the old nokia 1100,
being charged at 1st floor of our house (we have a 3 story building) at around 5 am. i was taking my workout clothes at that time. while i was exiting the room, my father came in and after that i never saw that phone again.


i am pretty sure my father has 2 sims as well. 
one time i was looking down at our street from our roof and i saw a ladies helmet, the ones that sort of looks like a construction hat, underneath my fathers helmet, when he was putting his helmet inside the storage inside his scooter.


one time my parents had a huge fight and i saw my father crying. seeing him cry i too busted into tears. at that time i asked my mother to stop falsely accusing my father of an affair as i was sure that my father would do no such thing but this was before i caught him in the incidents mentioned above.


now every other day, my parents fight. my mom went as far ahead as asking my father to divorce her and live with the other woman he's been with.


just now, my mothers sisters visited us, and my mom and her sister were sitting in another room. then my mom started crying but never said a word to her sister. 


seeing her cry has made me wonder about the situation my mother is in. she has so many things bottled inside her that she cant share it with anyone else.


my parents having been sleeping in separate rooms now for more than a year. 
my father sleeps on the sofa in our drawing room while my mother sleep in the bedroom.



all of this is also taking an emotional toll on me. 
my father is almost 50 years old. we dont have any problem at our house except this. i dont know why is he doing something that is destroying our peace. 


i dont know how to handle this situation.

For example, I remember that every time Honey Singh's name comes up people make fun of his music. While I am not a fan but do you think Honey Singh would have never faced any competition in life and millions of people, even if we assume they have shit music taste, were just waiting for him to release a song? Was his way to fame, money or selling music a cakewalk. There would have been many people like Honey Singh and even though his music might not be aesthetically or artsitically rich it is still influential and liked by millions which is no easy thing imo. 

People can give the example of Dhinchak Pooja etc but those were memes which died out. And seriously how many people know about them?

In Bollywood Salman Khan would be an example. People act as if his success is totally undeserved but can you tell why he gets audience in theatres but other ripped, good looking actors do not? There have been other decent to good looking ripped actors who did action or romantic movies but failed. When you look at his specific case the guy arguably started the gym culture in India. Again his movies are not something that I would call great but in the end the guy still found how to sell his movies (when he was going through a rough patch at one point and made a comeback) which many other actors don't.

1553718534.0,3,21,8,"TL;DR : 12th student super stressed about future and career. And I want to hear stories of people who’ve been successful w/o BTech, MBBS, or LLB. 

Hey everyone 

I’m going to be giving JEE, BITSAT, CET, etc but I’m not particularly interested in engineering. Physics and Chemistry make me cry. I’m going to be honest, I hate the idea of engineering. I have known since I started high school that I do not want to pursue engineering. I wanted to study commerce after 10th because I’m genuinely interested in economics, accounting, bst and those subjects. 

I was interested in becoming an actuary. Lots of people recommend PCM at the +2 level to strengthen my base in mathematics. I was still against it. After a lot of crying and trying to persuade my parents, I still had to take science. Fine it wasn’t their fault, many Bsc degrees did require PCM and they did for me. 

Now almost done with 12th boards, which I’ll probably get ~87 percent in because I genuinely hate physics and chemistry. And I have a lot of pressure to give JEE and many engineering entrances. Parents talked to colleagues and many of them said if she’s smart, why does she want to get a BSc? Recommended CSE or MnC at IITs. So now, I have to give those stupid entrances. 

After all of that, there’s doubt in my head about other degrees. BTech degrees seem like the only possible option if I want to make big bucks. I feel like if I don’t get a BTech, that’s it I’m done. No good career. 

So basically, after 10th I wanted to study commerce but couldn’t. Agreed to study PCM for Bsc in stats. Now I have to do engineering. I’m not studying anything that I want. Just because I get good grades in PCM does not mean it’s doesn’t make me want to rip my hair out, because it really does. 

The point of this post is, I want to hear success stories of people who haven’t done MBBS, BTech, or LLM/LLB. I want to be convinced that not studying engineering is not the end of the world. I feel really bad about my future now. So if anyone could help me out, I would really appreciate it.

I am a filmmaker and my film won a cash award at an Indian film festival. However, they have withheld 31.2% “as per government of India regulation” for taxes. 

This is confusing because they had specifically requested I provide them an official German document that establishes my tax residency in Germany and absolves them of taxing me in India (as I understood it). Of course, Germany will now expect me to pay taxes on this income as well. That is double taxation and seems to go against tax treaties between the two countries. 

I have clients from many countries, and have NEVER paid tax in any country than the one I was a resident in. Is India really operating under a completely different system?

Thank you all in advance. I hope I haven’t broken any rules for this subreddit. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for chiming in thus far.  I really appreciate it. That being said, many comments here have done a good job of explaining where the 31.2% figure came from, and why prize money is considered income and therefor taxed. I have no problem understanding that income of any shape is taxed. What isn’t clear, is why I’m paying said tax to INDIA, a country I do not live or work in; a county I cannot claim any government benefits from; a country I do not have a tax ID number in; a country I cannot file a tax return in. I’d like to add that I have clients from all over the world and have ever paid taxes to another government before. It’s simply not the way it works. I’m sure some of you here have at some point done work for a foreign company before, whether it be graphic design, programming, or anything. Did those clients underpay you tremendously and claim that they withheld that money to pay their local taxes on your behalf? Unlikely. Did you then happily pay taxes again in India on that income (double taxation)?

Second, it says ""Data at high speed"" and then ""Post which unlimited @ 64 Kbps"". What does this mean? Do I get high speeds or just 64 Kbps. Because I might watch YT and that speed is not enough for that. Third, how do I even get the sim card? I don't know how stuff works in India. Do I just go to some mobile shop and purchase the sim card? I want the most easiest way possible (probably get the same day I arrive) and cheapest.

So I'm a final year student at a one of the best private unis in India. This is the placement season and will be till April or May. I failed in most of the company exams and sometimes couldn't even clear the first round because there were coding rounds and all that crap. Anyhow I did manage to reach 3 interviews but somehow fucked up there too. My resume totally sucked ass, some lame ass skills and had done that shitty ass industrial training.If I had got job in the mass recruiters, I wouldn't be satisfied. Most of my friends got placed in them. I've heard some stories or interviews and how the students did nothing and some even showed their musically profile when asked about interests. I have no problem with that.

The thing is these companies are asking c,c++,ds,dbms,os and all that stuff and tbh how much I have tried to practice those I just don't have any interest in learning them no matter what anybody says. My goal is primarily to be a front end developer and maybe full stack someday ( I know there's coding and database involved here but I'm developing an interest here unlike the subjects I had failed to learn in the past 4 years or so) and I'm working on it, it'll probably take some months to build a good resume. I have to apply off campus probably ?

It feels like I'm just exaggerating over this stuff but really it's been bugging me for this past week. I've been doing nothing for the last two days and just listening to songs all day and daydreaming. December was off due to holidays and at home. I don't know what I'm doing tbh, feeling like a depressed person. It makes me more depressed when mom says ghar pe mat bethna bas. I don't know, I sit in front of my computer all day and I'm dependent on the Internet. I always wonder why people from CS background join coaching classes when there's so much stuff here online and you can buy courses for cheap than paying big bucks on coaching. (PS: I have coaching phobia now due to depressive experiences after high school ) 

Sales companies have been coming for quite some time (and I'm a huge Office fan lol) I don't know, should it be a good choice to join sales ? I wanna know what kind of work they have. Some friends got placed in sales for 5-6 lpa package. Impressive. How does it feel to work in sales for a CS student ?

I'm giving a last shot for placement. I'll probably mug basics of DS,C++ and DBMS tho I hate it so much. Am I being too harsh, ignorant and disrespectful to the opportunities ? I don't know. Some job is better than no job, right? I don't know man. I am also learning web dev related stuff side by side, though slowly for some days now.

Moreover, I have no family pressure. Parents are supportive and in a good financial condition. Two members of my family are working. My dad has quite an experience, he's working since 21 and around 55 now. I'm thankful to my family for what they have done for me. I'm not being forced upon like I have to take care of family. But deep inside I've got a point to prove by getting a job

My goals are to travel all over India on my money and produce music and learn new things.It'll be a relief when I get a job cuz for now I'm just holding back everything. Marriage is my least concern. I'm not against marriage but why have kids when you're not able to take proper care and provide them. I feel sad for the people who have to sacrifice their dreams even when they have the opportunity to make it big. 


Ok so, if nothing works out, will go for govt or bank jobs. They are respectable, according to my parents. 

Has anyone faced similar dilemma or you know something job related ?



tl;dr: Guy in final year not able to make career choice. Need some advice.

1551152284.0,3,10,17,"As the title suggests, the building in which my family has been living for the past couple years has a terrible family living on the floor above. There are two members in their family. Member A is the husband and Member B is the wife. The ‘suspect’ is the wife though let’s stick to the family for this discussion. Whenever the family are in their flat, the water supply finishes within 2 hours of the water being supplied from the municipality and filled in the building’s tank. The problem is 6 families live in this building with the 6th being in rent so they don’t care about this according to them. The culprit’s family and two more always support each other (because they are brothers and actual family) and then there’s my family and one other who have tried to confront the family time and again and get simply a weak response claiming that maybe the water force is weak or the pump doesn’t work well. Now the issue here is we have changed the building’s water pump twice and also confirmed that the force is strong from a municipality personnel but the water shortage still remains. 

Now comes the sad part. Whenever the suspected family leaves for a few days, the water supply of the building comes back to normal (i.e. water lasts full days). This is absolutely proven and even the other families supporting the suspected sometimes blurt this out. 

Not only am I complaining about the water shortage but also of the huge amount of water wastage done by that family at a time where a few significant number of countries don’t even have water to bathe. 

Whenever the family is home and the water from municipality comes at its designated time, we can hear a lot of water flowing down the pipes (thanks to the thin walls). 

Since the we don’t have majority support to properly confront the suspected family we are looking for a legal option. We don’t prefer the police (even though we might look into this option) because of the links of the family with the ruling political party. 

Any help will be godsend in this situation. 

Please note that it’s been around 5 years that we’ve been living like this where water goes out every 2 hours and only get water supply for a total of 4 hours a day (since water comes twice). Every fact mentioned here is extremely accurate and I and the other family supporting us is will to swear on this (if we go down the legal route)

I want to do data usage monitoring on the router than setting up data monitoring apps on each device I have. I read that a router that supports dd wrt is needed. Not sure about what it is but I'm 100% sure my router does not support this as it isn't in the list of routers that have the feature.  

Requirements : 

* Decent range(approximately 50 to 70m)    
  



* Dual bandwidth is not necessary as there are not many wifi networks in the area so congestion isn't an issue. I rarely use the 5 Ghz on my current router.  
  

* Bonus points if it supports guest network features with speed limitations. I don't want users to have access to my LAN network just because I gave them my wifi password. So setting up a guest network could be nice.  
  

* The ACT box is located in my house itself. So i dont think I'll need a modem. A CAT cable comes directly from the box which I assume can be directly connected to the router. Correct me if I'm wrong.

My questions are:

1. There is an EPIC form 002- which is filled and submitted to the local electoral office- can the forms be submitted in Delhi for a Karnataka voter ID as she is unable to travel to Karnataka right now?

2. There is a confusion between Form 001 on the NVSP website and the aforementioned EPIC 002 suggested on other websites- which one is correct?

3. Her name seems to be missing from the electoral rolls for 2019- in this case, will it be better to apply for a new card in Delhi which is her temporary residence and then apply for a transfer to Karnaraka which is her permanent address?

4. As domestic staff, she has no proof of residence in Delhi- her accounts, Adhaar card etc are all in her Karnataka address. Her mobile is prepaid. What can be used as a proof of residence for someone like this if we go for a voter card in Delhi?

B called me on the second day of training and told me that they are gaining many new skills and knowledge and the platform is so big that anyone can earn thousands based on their knowledge and dedication.  I had known about the MLM scam from last month (someone posted about QNet on this subreddit), so i asked him (B) and found out that job was related to marketing. I googled about the company and found out many people have been scammed by the same company (youtube, blogs, consumercompaints , i know all these sources are not reliable). I called my friend (B), and explained everything to him that how they (The trainers) manipulate and brainwash others and what kind of work they are going to do and how much money they will earn, and my friend (B) told me that he had the same feeling that it might be a scam (A guy, who first welcomed him to the training center was now glued to him and would not leave him alone for even a minute. He would wake him up in the morning, will have lunch/dinner with him, and pretty much everything). So he (B) watched the videos and blogs that i sent him and he told me that these exact things are happening to him.

Now, about the other guy (A), one who was approached by the DBA girl on facebook has been completely brain washed that he is not even trying to understand the situation, my friend (B) has tried many times but failed to make the other guy (A) understand (and the glued guy is making it even more hard). Today is the last day for registration (A has *passed* the final *interview*), and the company is telling him to pay 8k now and to purchase 45k worth of products (clothes) from their company after few days. We (me and the other guy- B) have tried to stop him from registering but failed.

53000 rs. is a big amount for that guy (A) and he is desperate to get a job. Now he has started to get angry and has told us to mind our own business .We can not press him any further. 

Any idea how to convince him or how to deal with this situation?

This is my first time backpacking solo, and the first time I will be in India (and Asia for that matter). I will be flying in from Singapore. Any recommendations for which cities I should go to/which itinerary to follow? Any cities I MUST see? Any that would not be worth my time with only a week there?

About me: 21, male, more into hiking/outdoors/scenic stuff rather than nightlife (although I would consider going out a night or two), travelled a bit in Europe with a group (Ireland, Italy, France, Spain).

1549804448.0,3,8,11,"I work in management consulting wherein my team is usually young (mid 20s to early 30s), from top b-schools and have a good gender ratio whereas the clients we need to interact with the most are usually in senior management (CXO, CXO -1, CXO -2 levels) and are mostly men in their 50s and are from variety of backgrounds.

I have observed a number of older men who are uncomfortable working with women especially when the woman is demanding and doesn't act like a subordinate. 

Sometimes, it is overt. I have had a PSU bank GM once ask me informally how I manage to work under a woman (my manager for the project was a woman). On most occasions, however, it is covert. In a stint at a factory, during our weekly meetings (which used to be pretty fiery), the rest of us got to argue with the clients, but, whenever my female colleague spoke, she was shut down by the plant manager (although they used to be very respectful of her and call her ""madam"" all the time) pretty quickly.

In my current assignment, my female subordinate told me that our key client never looks at her when he talks to her. I observed that it was true and very odd - whereas he is completely normal when he is speaking to any guy. He hardly ever spoke to her and always interacted with me even on topics she was working on. Initially, I attributed it to the fact that he is a senior person and probably doesn't want to talk to the junior-most member of the team. So, I encouraged her to directly call him and present her own topics in meetings. However, he just doesn't take calls from her. This one time there was an error in her output, but, that was purely because his subordinate had supplied us erroneous data. So, he called her and shouted at her and hung up even before she could speak. When she told me about it, I verified her work and found the error in the data provided to us (which could have not been cross-checked as well) . So, I asked her to shoot him a mail showing the error. 

I also called him up and he was very nice to me and apologized for sending the wrong data. But, he never apologized to my subordinate.

   I was 13 when we had come back to our home town, the plan was to find a new job in a month. But most of the jobs that were offered to my father we're rejected by him as the salary was lower than what he used to earn.
Fast forward to four years, he has fallen into depression. He emptied most of his savings and now depends on his brothers for help, which I'm sure will stop soon too.
We've had regular quarrels regarding his state but he just isn't ready to let go of his ego and take up a smaller job. It is impacting us and our functioning as well. I'm especially worried about my little sister and what impact my father is currently having on her.

   Three days ago, I had an agreement with him. I'll sign him up for jobs on websites and in return, if a recruiter calls him, he will take the job. So please help me, I want him to become healthy asap. And I want our home to be peaceful again. I've tried sending his resume to a lot of companies but none have called yet.


If you have or know of any vacancy that is suitable for him please pm me, I'll send you a resume.

He's 53 years old.

He has a degree in B.Tech Mechanical

He has an experience of 20 years of working in steel industrial projects.

1549441951.0,3,20,18,"Bsnl provides a Fibre based internet connection(FTTH) to its consumers.And it changed the plan at the beginning of February without notifying the pre-existing customers about this change.

Let me take an example of the previous 777 plan and compare it with the new plan.

The old plan was - upto 50 Mbps till 500 GB, upto 2Mbps beyond.

The updated plan is - upto 50 Mbps till 18 GB/day, upto 2Mbps beyond(This would amount to 540 GB on average per month).

At first glance it would look like an improvement over the previous plan, but here's the kicker the Updated plan forces you to use the 18GB per day instead of the old plan which allowed you to use any amount of data at the 50 Mbps speed per day as long as you were below the 500 GB fup.

If u were to use more than 18 GB/day on the updated plan, the speed would go down to 2 Mbps after 18 GB on that day (fup on a daily basis).

If u were to use less than 18 GB/day on the updated plan ,the remaining data would be lost therefore under-utilizing the plan.

Edit: The 777 and 1277 plans have been reverted to the previous ""500GB"" and ""750 GB"" respectively. Thanks to the reddit user u/abtam11 for notifying about the changes.

[https://telecomtalk.info/bsnl-rs777-broadband-plan-removal/190707/](https://telecomtalk.info/bsnl-rs777-broadband-plan-removal/190707/) 

TLDR: The Updated plan basically enforces an fup on a daily basis instead of a monthly basis which is unacceptable on a brodband connection.

1549448862.0,3,9,1,"Dear speakers of Gujarati,

I would love to listen to and learn more about the phenomenon of ""murmur""/""breathy voice"" in Gujarati and to be able to pronounce it myself in order to learn the difference between a normal \[h\] and this Gujarati way of merging the \[h\] with a vowel. Gujarati is a special language, because murmur is said to occur in it more than in any other language.

Wikipedia says you use murmur in Gujarati in three special cases. (The murmur is phonetically represented by two dots under the vowel in question): 

1. At the beginning of words, where an 'h' is formally written but not pronounced as such. For example: the written હવે \[ɦəʋe\] ""now"" you pronounce as \[ə̤ʋe\]; \[ɦɑɽkũ\] ""bone"" as \[ɑ̤ɽkũ\].
2. When in a written word a vowel is preceded by an 'h' and an unstressed vowel (schwa). For example: The written સહેલું \[səɦelũ\] ""easy"" you pronounce as સેલું \[sɛ̤lũ\]; બહું \[bəɦoɭũ\] ""large"" as \[bɔ̤ɭũ\]; દહાડો \[d̪əɦɑɽo\] ""day"" as દાડો \[d̪a̤ɽo\].
3. When a vowel is preceded by and' h' and an 'a'/schwa, which you pronounce with a glide (right...?). For example: written \[ɾəɦi\] ""stayed"" is pronounced as \[ɾə̤j\]; \[bəɦu\] ""very"" as \[bə̤ʋ\].

Also in irregular Gujarati verbs like કહેવું ""to say"", it says on the internet that murmur occurs a lot.

I would love to hear some spoken examples of this so called ""murmur"", but I could not find any audio pronunciations of these individual words on e.g. Google Translate. Moreover I only study Sanskrit, but do not speak any living Indian languages, so when I listen to e.g. the news in Gujarati, the phenomenon happens too quickly for me to notice it.

For more details: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati\_phonology#Murmur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati_phonology#Murmur)

Which is why I turned to you with some questions:

1. Do you have any recordings to recommend in which the phenomenon happens? Preferably the words should be pronounced clearly and slowly, if possible even in the 'formal' written way and in the 'informal' normal way as you'd say it on the streets, so those who do not speak can clearly distinguish between the two.
2. If you do not know of any such recordings, would you make one yourself? :)
3. Does this murmur occur in any other Indian languages you know of, like Marathi or Hindi?

Looking forward to hearing from you.",t5_2qh1q,For native Gujarati speakers: What does ''murmur'' sound like? I would love some slow recordings of this ''murmur''/''breathy voice. [repost],https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/anpf4u/for_native_gujarati_speakers_what_does_murmur/

&amp;#x200B;

**Overview of the incidents**:

1. While walking down the street holding her boyfriends hand, a teenage boy reached out and groped one girls breasts. The couple stopped to confront the boy and the boy fled laughing.  This same girl was groped by boy on a motorcycle passing by with his friends less than 100m down the road. The boyfriend slapped the man for his sexual assault on his girlfriend. A bunch of local men stood by and no one offered to help.
2. One girl in our group was groped by a man passing by while she was out looking for dinner. When confronted, the man just shrugged it off like this was normal acceptable behaviour. 
3. Another girl in our group had a man 'brush' his hand against her groin while she was walking down the street. When confronted the man seemed to not care. 
4. Another girl was verbally harassed by some teenage boys on a motorbike outside her hotel. She was too scared to go out for dinner. 
5. A Tuk Tuk driver put his hand on a passengers leg for an extended period of time and consistently made inappropriate jokes about one of the girls. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we're asking - Is this normal for Jaipur? Are we safe to walk around the streets alone? Why is it that everywhere else we've been in India we've only encountered kindness, support and respect.

I wanted to buy a new carrom board for home. After searching online for which is the best carrom brand / board in India, I came to know about an online shop that sells good carrom boards.

The model that I ordered (Precise Elegant Bulldog Carrom board, 24 mm, Price Rs. 7749) was delivered to our place in Bangalore in few days. I was so happy before unboxing the packing, curious about what's so special about such an expensive board.

I even made an unboxing video. Immediately while unboxing we observed that board's frame/cushion had 3 cracks. One of the cracks was so severe that it reached near the playing surface.

I sent the unboxing video to shop owner. Had a length discussion with him. According to him - 

1. It's unfortunate that the board is damaged. It was sent in mint condition, the courier guys must have dropped it.
2. The defects are minor, it won't affect playing. 
3. They cannot replace the board because as per ""their policy"" they won't replace if there is no issue with the playing area. \[BTW, this policy is not mentioned anywhere on their website\]
4. I should try to fix it with feviquick.
5. I should ""consider"" the fact that already they have given a ""discounted"" product, if customer buys from another shop/online store it will cost Rs. 11,000
6. I should play on the board and see if the playing area is okay.

\---

After this I tested the playing area of the board. Due to the crack near middle of one side, the rebound was not coming properly. I made this video and sent it to him \[Link to video in comments\]

Below is our discussion over call with him after sending the video \[link in comments\]

According to him, it is nobody's fault that they board got damaged! We should pay the return courier charges if we want replacement. The board weighs 25kg, it will be costly affair to send it to Mumbai from Bangalore.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my wife are both frustrated. Having spent so much on a defective board. Had the board been available on Amazon or some other online store with decent return policy, we would have ordered from there.

&amp;#x200B;

I have travelled around the world. I have been to 5 continents, and nonetheless India is my favourite place to visit. The extremes are quiet profound in India. Like, sometimes you meet someone with some deep philosophical or technological understanding and sometimes you meet someone who fucks you up as you would not even dare to do it to your own enemy. There are good and bad in every cultural. We still have to appreciate that India is a very peaceful country. In other part of the world where they have extreme class difference like in India are much more violent and crime rates are much higher, where as in India there is no violence, which I really love.

&amp;#x200B;

My question: why fraud mentality is it so prevalent in India? Even in general day to day life, making someone a chutiya is taken as fun and more people you make fool of or take advantage of; you are taken as a ""smart"" person. This phenomenon has its root into Indian sociocultural. In other culture this would be taken as fraud but in India, its very common in a sense that it is everywhere. Where does this thing come from, whats the root? Is it religion, class difference? what is it? whenever I travel in India I ask this question to my self.

I am a 26 years old freelance developer from hyderabad. I am currently stuck in a tight situation which I feel might convert into a legal issue, yesterday i received an email from one of the partners of a retail startup for which i was developing a website until last year requesting to pay back 50% of the project amount else action would be taken. Due to constant changes from client's end the project failed. Since one of the partners was a close friend and I was new to legal side of freelancing, there was no contract signed apart from non-disclosure agreement and everything else was done via emails.

&amp;#x200B;

Email that i received yesterday:

 \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear xxxxx,

This is with reference to your engagement for the development of our website www.xxxxx.com. While we engaged your services on the basis of your projection of being capable enough to develop the website, at the end of nearly 8 months, we were left with a half baked, non functional product that was of no use to us, nor could have ever been useful given the manner that it lacked basics required in any E-Commerce platform. This has not just resulted in the project being considerably delayed by also in losses due to not being able to transact. 

While we understand that you put in considerable effort, there was a huge gap in your capability and experience to implement one. We kindly request you to return 50%of the amount paid to you since we did not get what was supposed to be delivered, nor could we continue any further or get any support for the subsequent year as was discussed. 

Request you to do the needful by the 15th of February, post which we might consider taking action as we deem fit to ensure the right remedy. 

Warm regards, 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

background of the project and timelapse:

Around july 2017  I was referred by one of my clients to a project in which he was a partner,they wanted an e-commerce website. I presented my quote and was selected for the project. They mentioned initially they had only 4 types of products and each product's way of calculation was different (some needed to be sold via fixed stock, some would be sold via size in ft/meters etc). and they wanted to have an android app in future aswell, given the complex requirement i proposed to build the website in laravel framework instead of using a CMS like wordpress, and the database could also be used for the android app they built in future.  


They agreed and left it to me to decide on the matter (since they did not have the knowledge regarding the same). after few weeks the project was stuck because the client was in the process of creating a registered bank account for his company which was needed for payumoney (which was one of the payment providers to be used on the site, other being paypal for international customers), but the client was rejected by couple of banks and the project was stalled indefinitely.  


After about 2 months they resumed after they had setup their bank account and had finally setup the payumoney account which then allowed us to use their API. hence i integrated it in the application.

&amp;#x200B;

In the mean time I had created different product pages based on the product type (and their calculation methods and other features like image cropping and recording the cropped co-ordinate positions)

  
After which the client started providing textual content and other content for the site (which were added and cross checked by them aswell). then I was stuck with the application due to one of the requirements which was to forward the customers based on their country to either .com or .in domain, and show different prices based on the country. It took some time but was eventually implemented.

&amp;#x200B;

After which the client said to change  one of the product's calculation methods because they don't sell it in fixed quantity rolls but custom sizes, i did not request for additional charges here and implemented the same and also provided a video walk though for the same.

&amp;#x200B;

In the subsequent weeks, client started asking and modifying other things on the site similarly (and i did not ask for additional charges again).  


\* redesigning home page over 4 times and loading its data dynamically

\* photoshop work for images

\* feature modifications and others

&amp;#x200B;

At one point where the product types reached 7. I asked the client to pay additional amount for any more types that were going to be added there after, the client agreed and paid for the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Then when the website was in final stages there were a few bugs which were being mitigated, the client asked for design changes(which was explicitly mentioned by me in the specification email itself that design can either be purchased from envato or you can hire someone with approx cost, they went ahead with an envato html design). and also a dynamic cart(cart details via ajax) and coupon functionality was requested. I had implemented the coupon functionality but for the dynamic cart i asked them to hire another freelancer for dynamic cart functionality since i did not get enough time due to other commitments. The client was also not happy with the project and wanted me to exit from the project, hence i suggested that i would act as consultant and provide advice and support if required.  

&amp;#x200B;

Along with the person who was the point of contact (who represented them) we posted the requirements on [freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com) and got a freelancing team to work on mobile menu design functionality and dynamic cart. I provided assistance and ideas on how to implement it. The freelancer implemented it, then problems started occurring overall on the website due to complexities issues that were introduced due to the dynamic cart functionality(add to cart and remove cart item functionality and guest cart system), I tried my best to fix those and fixed it to a certain extent. In the mean time the client proceeded to do campaigns and other activities to drive traffic on the site. But sales were not being generated. 

And the client kept on consistently blaming the website for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The client then approached a digital marketer  who found a few more bugs and website design issues, the client approached back to me to fix the bugs aswell and design changes, I was stuck in a tight spot and fixed the bug aswell as added the design changes aswell, similarly couple of more bugs were found, and i fixed them aswell, then during one of the conversations client started asking me to add more functionalities to the site which i rejected and we had a heated discussion(between one of the partner and me) and i didnt want to continue with them any longer (my friend who had referred me to this project also suggested me to exit the project aswell). This happened around june-july in 2018

&amp;#x200B;

They went ahead with the digital marketer whose company also provided magento development services and developed the site from scratch in magento but none of the custom and complex functionalities which were there in the laravel site that I had developed.

&amp;#x200B;

During their development, they sought my help with regards to amazon s3 storage setup and hosting issues which i assisted them with for free of cost.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple of weeks back I was contacted by the clients side again as their current developer had issues implementing some of the features which there in the old website. but since i didnt have any experience with magento and i didnt want to do anymore work for them i had rejected the same.

&amp;#x200B;

And yesterday i got that email.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I am quite afraid as i don't have any idea how to handle this legally, and i don't have any funds either. due to the time investment i had done in this project i lost alot of revenue from other sources hence i was in very bad state financially. now that i had started to level, this problem arised.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would really be appreciated.

When it's my exam time, they usually have stupid prayer ceremonies ""havan kund chutiyon ka jhund"", play music or watch Star plus at maximum volume, When it's her exam time, I can't play video games as the clicking of mouse is ""distracting"" to her (we live in a one bedroom apartment home, so it's kinda cramped in here, and the old bitch needs to watch star plus daily).  It's not like I'm a moron or she's a genius, she barely even passed despite not having to study while listening to stupid prayers. I love video games.

It's perfectly fine when they watch those stupid bitchy shows on Star plus 4 hours a day, but of I play video games for an hour, I'm the spoiled brat.

However since the last few months, many drivers have asked me to make payment via cash only &amp; they argued harshly with me when I insisted on PayTM. Initially I was unfazed by their arguments and continued to pay thru PayTM only; however since last month, many drivers are directly cancelling my booking once they find that I am paying thru PayTM, without even asking me once.

The situation has become so bad that nowadays I have started paying the drivers by cash only; otherwise I won't be able to travel by Uber/Ola anywhere in the city...

Now I don't know the exact reason why they are insisting on cash payment only, but many drivers have told me that they need the cash to fill diesel/petrol daily. But I don't agree with it, because they are getting weekly salary right? So why not plan accordingly by setting apart a fixed amount of cash everyday for the fuel filling?

Only Indian adverts count.

I'll go first.


**Niine sanitary pads**
I think they capture a genuine moment between father and daughter. I think the best part is that it's father and daughter, not mother and daughter, which is really striking. It shows that fathers have just as much of a responsibility towards their daughters as mothers. The moral they give is undoubtedly necessary.


**Naukri.com**
The Hari Sadu adverts I felt were great. Though, it may not have been top-notch comedy, it was certainly memorable enough that I still remember them.


**Coca-Cola**
The one with Siddhart Malhotra and Alia Bhatt playing the newly married couple. The presence of big stars actually takes away from the story, but their acting is muted enough that it passes. It impresses me that they were able to tone down their 'big star' personalities and really get into the characters. The story's strength is its simplicity. I do think that the ending is a bit too Bollywood/melodramatic, tho.

The **Coca-Cola** 'Taste the Feeling' (one with the Avicii song) and **Gillette** 'Best A Man Can Get' adverts are awesome, but they're not Indian so they don't actually count.

1546753165.0,3,8,0,"Hello everyone,

I've got my first job and its the contract ending with the ending of this month. I'd gone through a real emotional turmoil during those 70+ odd interviews.

Though I've made myself content by started to read game of thrones books and most of the time quora and reddit.

My hobbies are acting dramatics and i do like to write stories.

About you, you should be self motivated about your career and relations. I would not want someone who just like those fake or small talks and then vanish away.

If it turns out good I'd definitely marry. I'm not someone who is just lurking around for sexual favours or something. I appreciate the thoughts and the importance it has while falling for love.

so looking forward keep talking in chats and then if you want I can move near you as well. I already have interviews for job opportunities in Germany, sweeden, Netherlands, Singapore and mighty USA. ( Since EU countries allows developers to get there) 

So I want to see how much our frequency matches.

My soul purpose of putting this post here to get some feedback on myself. Since I do hangout with people from office have some drinks with them but then I mostly found is they ignore me for even Lunch or tea break times. 

I have started understanding the whole Football world by following those Premier League, UEFA, LaLiga, that is going on right now thank to reddit. And putting all that effort just so that I can converse and make more friends with people who are deeply involved in Football world. But still its the same people just ignore or forget about me.

The thing which annoys me the most is I can't keep doing small talk for everyday for 2-3 months I want someone reliable to be my friend and keep talking to me, like I have this concept of being best friend you do remember the past talks otherwise its like talking to a vending machine. 

The thing that saddens me the most is I see a lot of nay-sayers, shallow, less-knowledgable persons getting awesome jobs and girls but when I see myself that I'm doing all those work and not achieving I feel so much sad and I just look down on myself so much. I'm not some creep or introvert who can't make conversations I do try it and hold the conversation but why god why? Like if you want to talk about cosmetics I would like to talk about what Revelon is doing with their products etc.

So all my fellow Indians here please guide me as I'm feeling so out of life and my path in terms of career and personal life as well. Mom at back home is looking for girls to directly marry me, I'm not saying I don't want to marry but then they control that I can't talk to a girl who is like 4-5 years elder to me so I have a lot of BS to tackle.

I'm yet to understand all those financial taxation and how will I invest to have a good savings in coming years I also need to help my dad with that house loan but not much burden is there.

Will life be like this all the time in India where you are just moving on roads with crowd hustling for going to job and come back to cook on my own ( that too sometimes backfire and make a messy cooker :D) I got really afraid after I have seen recent interview of Anurag Kashyap saying that in India we are just barely able to survive. I don't want to digest that but I know that's the truth. And even this tech giant metro city I feel all alone every day after coming back from office and after cooking.

I want to visit USA for a few days with my wife, so have scheduled interview in March. I am a freelancer who has an American client who can give me an invitation letter, while all expenses will be paid by ourselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is what should be the 'format' of that invitation letter? I see there are some example formats online which I can use &amp; change the text as per my case. Now, should my client print it out on a paper \[their letterhead may be\], sign, scan it &amp; give me a copy which I'll print again?

I represent a foundation which is planning to institute grants and scholarships for doctoral students in the social sciences in India. This is not a call for submissions!  Just questions to help me understand how things work in India. Appreciate input from folks based in India who have completed a doctoral level program in the social sciences/humanities in the last decade or so, or folks who are closely associated/collaborating with Indian academia. Please do not feel obligated to answer all questions - just one or two is fine! 

1. Is admission to a doctoral program separate from a Masters program or are the two combined? How does an M Phil. fit into all this? 

2. In the US, a doctoral student would typically cover expenses through a mix of teaching, research, tuition waivers, grants and scholarships etc. How does a PhD candidate in India meet their expenses? 

3. How much does it cost to go through a doctoral program at a state university like U of Delhi or JNU, versus a private institution like ISB in Hyderabad or IIM Ahmedabad?

4. Can you give an estimate of living expenses for students pursuing a program in a city that is not their hometown? Broad question I know but an estimate for major metro like Delhi or Bangalore and a second level city like Pune would help. 

5. How does a candidate typically meet research expenses when their thesis requires field research?

5. At what stage does a candidate settle on their thesis? 
 
And finally name what you think is the best social sciences school in India. Aside from the one you graduated from!

2. I intend to leave the 401K account untouched until I turn 60 (or should I do a traditional IRA rollover?).

1. Reading on the internet, I understand that I will need to report the 5% paper gains on my Indian tax return each year. But does that mean I also pay the Indian authorities taxes on the paper-gain amount each year? Or its just reporting but I don’t have to pay taxes on it?

1. I return home continue to work with service based company I am currently employed with, apply for final GC application in a year. 26 Lacs/annum
2. I come to India, quit my current employer . Forget Greencard  for a while, get 75 Lacs/yr

We don't allow them to vote until they reach the right age. **We don't even trust them with driving until they reach the right age.** So how is it that somehow it is *okay* to indoctrinate religious stuff in kids and teach them to fear a psychotic God that harshly punishes them if they don't bow down in front of an idol or say/do anything against the said deity and other such stuff? Or teaching them to attack and kill anyone that does not belong to their own religion? Why the violent programming? Why the fear indoctrination? Why the child abuse? And how and why does our society and our world consider it okay to do such stuff to impressionable kids? That too, when we don't consider them to be ""at the right age"" to understand things for themselves and/or be capable of making their own decisions? Isn't something fundamentally wrong here?  

And I would argue the same even if anyone was to scare kids off with atheism/agnosticism or whatever else. Let them grow older. Let them develop the abilities to think for themselves. I mean, on one hand we all agree that an adult fucking a 14-year-old even WITH their consent equals paedophilia because the teen in question isn't ""mature enough"" to understand the implications of sexual relationships. But it is okay for some adult to drill fear porn and insanity inside kids' impressionable minds and everyone thinks it's *okay*? What the fucking fuck?

I have sent an email to [care@irctc.co.in](mailto:care@irctc.co.in). To be frank I am trying to register on the website for more than three months. First time i tried the international payment was not even working. I tried again now I was able pay but it has problem sending OTP.

The implementation of website is really amateurish. I mean I can book an airline ticket without even registering a profile.

I don't want to belittle the developers. Have these developers seen a booking website before? Whoever was tasked to build the website had done a terrible job. It is one of the worst website I have used so far.

When asked anyone Indian railways, most of them are proud of  the fact that it's one of largest railways in the worlde. Whats the point when simple things such as website is not even working properly.

So I went to another bank india to open the account, I was told manager is available come afer one week. I was like WTH? Then didn't bother trying again. I am not sure if it just me or everyone else have the same experience.

Spent quite a bit of time uploading the photos and arranging them in an album using their tool (based on Flash).

&amp;#x200B;

Time comes to pay and I discover all my attempts are unsuccessful.

&amp;#x200B;

Wait for India morning (I am doing from US, using my US cards) and call their customer service. They are very polite and apologetic and tell me they cannot accept non-Indian credit cards  (was using Visa). I am left speechless. An online store and they cannot cards I can used all over the world!

&amp;#x200B;

Best they can help is to suggest I can ask the person to pay to whom I am sending this surprise gift!

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something here?

Remember when we dramatically posted here, [""Help! Stop India from becoming a surveillance state""](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a8jp77/please_help_stop_india_from_becoming_a/)? This was when around the end of December last year a MHA notification was issued authorising 10 central agencies to snoop in computers. As we explained this was incredibly problematic, since it was without any proper checks and balances. 

While the public pressure did work to an extent and more people became aware of the issue, due to a lack of a positive response by the Government, we were forced along with 4 other petitioners to approach the Supreme Court. Today the court agreed to hear this case and issued notice in it directing a response by the Government.

1549991535.0,5,27,198,"Over the past two months, we have been a noisy bunch over at r/India. Making posts every other day about online privacy, censorship and net neutrality. As we explained in detail with our [republic day letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ajyuju/a_republic_day_letter_from_iff/), this is because one of our principal goals is towards community building and organising. Our core belief is that battles on digital rights will only be won with greater public engagement.

Over the longer term, this will require high-quality staff. It will include programme officers who look at movements in policy process. A talented team of product technologists, community organisers, designers and even meme-makers to support and spark public campaigns. A policy technologist with whom IFF's lawyers can talk and understand technology, before they craft a constitutional argument.

But, this will only be possible with funding. The right type.  From every day (and night) internet users like you.

At IFF we recognise, to ask for money we have to provide a continuing utility. Value through our work, engagement and listening to your concerns closely. Forging a meaningful link between IFF and its donors. This is why we have to built a [membership program with recurring donations](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/). This model helps us have a predictable flow of funds and focus on our work. More importantly, it challenges IFF to meaningfully stay in touch with its individual donors. This is the culture we are creating where our funder profile matches with our work for internet users in India.

We invite you to try it out this membership model. Donations start as small as Rs. 100 a month and go up to Rs. 1500. For all members, we undertake to send monthly email updates and respond meaningfully. This even includes a quarterly call with IFF leadership for the highest tier of supporters. So, please consider a contribution by [clicking here](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/).

And, even if you do not for the moment want to make a financial contribution at present, please do consider upvoting this on Reddit or sharing this post on social media. We promise to continue our mission for fighting the tough fights, for your digital rights --  on the internet, in policy consultations, committee rooms, parliament and courts.

In gratitude,

Team IFF

Valid or invalid? 

Now, without context this is going to ruffle a LOT of feathers the wrong way, so let me clarify:
1. I do not identify to any caste and never been affected/needed the benefits of the reservation policies. 
2. I understand the sentiment behind reservation: to give an equal footing to all peoples disadvantaged by archaic societal beliefs.

If we look back at the development of our demographic's quality of  life since independence, can we say that reservation has helped?

Would this development have occured without reservation?

Why are there still individuals of the reserved group who are downtrodden? 

When aligned according to similar economic conditions, do caste based distinctions in the population still stay visible in the quality of life?

The move came two days after Trump’s reference to India as a “very-high tariff nation” and his demand for a “reciprocal tax” on goods from India is in keeping with Washington’s concerted attacks on India’s trade stance.

Exports to the US from India under GSP — at $5.7 billion — were over 13.25% of India’s total goods exports of $43 billion to the US that year, and a far smaller proportion compared to India’s total exports. The US goods trade deficit with India was $22.9 billion in 2017.

However, blanket removal of the GSP scheme for India means that about 1,900 products exported by the country to the US will be hit.

Today I learned that the courts in India (or is it only the Bombay High Court) can restrict a defendant or litigant from representing themselves and can decide to legally require them to be represented by a lawyer.

This is something similar to the absurd requirement that tax returns of individuals who trade in equities and derivatives file their returns as a business and get their returns attested/filed by a CA.

Summary:
&gt; **The long-standing debate on growth and development has been renewed in recent works of Jagdish Bhagwati and Amartya Sen. This paper intervenes in this debate with evidence from Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu, which, unlike Kerala, did not have initial advantages over Gujarat, outperforms the latter on nearly every development indicator at the level of indicators as well as in the rate of change. This is despite Gujarat having a slightly higher economic growth rate. Tamil Nadu’s relative success is the result of state intervention in providing essential public services. Further, the history of social mobilisation in the state has been crucial in ensuring the formulation and efficient execution of social welfare measures.**",t5_2qh1q,"A Comparison of Developmental Outcomes in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, 12-Apr-2014 | Economic and Political Weekly",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ah7zht/a_comparison_of_developmental_outcomes_in_gujarat/

1550124529.0,5,8,100,"Thinking about the last time I got a valentines day letter takes me back to senior school. Around 2002, when the internet was around, but still not quite... everywhere. As the years rolled on, promises of a digital transformation emerged in sputters. I think I was not alone when I hoped that gigabytes of bandwidth could cure all ills. Fix our lives -- even larger social problems. Well, we are still not quite there.

But our lives are not quite the same.

In time, many of us have grown to not only use but love the free and open internet. But each day it is under threat. Take, for instance -- the ""Intermediary rules"". Any changes to them will impact all of us.

Think about the legal rules that govern your ISP (Airtel, Idea-Vodafone, Jio or others), or large social media platforms (Wikipedia, Github, Facebook, Sharechat, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter etc.), or even smaller start-up online services you use and enjoy (for me, it is IndianKanoon). Changes proposed to these rules not only massively change your online experience but also threaten your online privacy and free speech. 

**So how can you prevent these changes?**

* First, get to know about the Intermediary Rules. To make it easier, we have collaborated to create a video explainer. Yes, please do *youtube and chill* ([English version](https://youtu.be/TfMEOF3gL6g) / [Hindi Version](https://youtu.be/MCh835mOt3I%E2%80%8B)) 
* Second, tell the government to roll back these proposals. How? [Click on this link](https://internetfreedom.in/civil-society-and-research-organisations-are-unanimous-proposed-changes-to-intermediary-rules-must-be-recalled/) and follow three simple steps given at the end. 

These proposed changes illustrate the wider threats to our online freedom. To help win on these battles we need an organised fighting force for our civil liberties. This is where IFF comes in. This week we have rolled out a [membership plan](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/) to make you an integral part of our work. The Reddit Community has been a core supporter of our work and we continue to call on you to do more! Please do try it out, -- send it to any friends or family to sign up as well. It has a system of recurring donations and different membership tiers. We offer some benefits and promise to remain in constant touch.

As always, I invite you to explore [our work](https://internetfreedom.in/) and personally value any feedback. We are listening to you and we know you share our love for the free and open internet!

There seems to be no mention of the Rs 10 coin on the official RBI page for the coin denominations.

&gt;Coins in India are presently being issued in denominations of 10 paise, 20 paise, 25 paise, 50 paise, one rupee, two rupees and five rupees. Coins upto 50 paise are called 'small coins' and coins of Rupee one and above are called 'Rupee Coins'. Coins can be issued up to the denomination of Rs.1000 as per the Coinage Act, 1906.

Interestingly, it also says that the 10 ps through 50 ps are valid denominations even though nobody accepts those today.

As we had [posted before](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a92n0h/india_must_resist_the_lure_of_the_chinese_model/) the Ministry of IT was considering changes to the IT Intermediary Guidelines Rules, 2011. These changes were being considered in secret with social media companies and after [the Indian Express did a front page story](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/it-act-amendments-data-privacy-freedom-of-speech-fb-twitter-5506572/) and [we released](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/) the entire text of these rules, a [public consultation](http://meity.gov.in/comments-invited-draft-intermediary-rules) on it was announced.

These changes will harm all of us who use the internet. They will break end-to-end encryption, make indefinite data retention possible and will also require pro-active censorship by algorithms on platforms.  Please do [read our analysis here](https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/).

Tomorrow the Ministry of IT is doing two things. It has first invited a select group of people for consultation on these rules. This will be attended by our executive director [Apar Gupta](https://twitter.com/apargupta84) and IFF Chairperson [Raman Chima](https://twitter.com/tame_wildcard). We will update you on what happens there.

The second thing it will be doing is that Ministry officials will conduct a [twitter Q&amp;A](https://twitter.com/GoI_MeitY/status/1081071055366701057) with the hashtag #SaferSocialMedia between 4-5 PM. Close to this Q&amp;A we will be tweeting model questions from [our twitter handle](https://twitter.com/internetfreedom) around that time. In addition to using the IT ministry's hashtag #SaferSocialMedia we will also be using #SaveOurPrivacy.

We request and call on all redditors to participate. For privacy and free speech!

It's been a week since we re-activated SaveTheInternet.in. and we have received overwhelming support! Here is an update on the reports of website blocking over the last week.

Over the last few months, IFF has been on the look out for Net Neutrality violations. Through an online [reporting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfW1hG9msgaILOLk1EMEY3V3UDJIZlTJPRoxgkIO7pUzuZ2aA/viewform)**,** we gathered evidence of extensive blocking carried out by not just one but various ISP’s all over the country. We created a [data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5ToesR8HCcH6bmP_s7s5jN6YlYw4t4l-ovCpmY7xyc/edit#gid=1822363676) and [provided a summary](https://internetfreedom.in/more-than-100-people-report-violations-of-net-neutrality-all-over-india-we-need-enforcement-action/) of the reports based on the information collected. A round total of 200 responses of blockings beginning January, 2019 to March 2019 was received.

In light of these rampant violations, we thought it fit to re-activate our #SaveTheInternet website and a week has passed since. The website has ""[**Take Action Petition**](https://savetheinternet.in/petition/)"" button, which allows individuals and organisations to show support to list of joint demands which is then sent to the relevant government offices. The purpose behind this decision was move beyond email support for net neutrality to active petitioning.  In this short period of a mere week, we have received tremendous support with about 970 signings.

The website also has the option to [**submit reports**](https://savetheinternet.in/report/) of any net neutrality violations to us. In addition to our earlier 200, we have received a further of 65 reports of such continued blocking. This is a brief analysis of the latest reports.

### Broad Trends

* We continue to see general blocking of porn, proxy, VPN, torrent and streaming websites; Streamable, College humour, Sound cloud, Telegram, Reddit and Alexa.com, as we did in our previous reports.  


https://i.redd.it/fp9bu0kgugo21.png

* There have been a few responses that indicate blocking of sites that measure internet speeds, gaming sites and some report pure latency being introduced for certain websites.
* A large portion of these connections are mobile based but there have been a number of wired connections reports as well.
* The ISP conducting the highest amount of blockings is Jio, both mobile and wired with some from Airtel, Hathway, You Broadband, Spectra amongst a few others. The blockings have been widespread, ranging from Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal to Maharashtra, Karnataka to name a few states.
* The most recent report that has drawn a considerable reaction from users is the blocking of indiankanoon and earlier today, taxscan. Claims are that a Government order has been provided for indiakanoon, however, there has been no evidence or reason for the blocking. Additionally, after this blocking was discovered, access has been restored to the website.

A consolidated datasheet of the form which redacts the personal details of the respondents is [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NvHjlRQSrfZZ2jTq3Qy97-Jla0AVnrAIo59smAvZ4wg/edit?usp=sharing). In our efforts to address these violations, we plan on sending a detailed response to the Department of Telecommunications and the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of India of our findings. Please do continue to [report any violations](https://savetheinternet.in/report/), it will aid in taking necessary steps further. If you haven't shown your support for Net Neutrality yet, make your way to this [link right here and sign the petition](https://savetheinternet.in/petition/)!

The problems faced by the farmers large stem from their own community. At this point a large portion of them are basically economic liabilities.

It's is wasteful where 50% of our population generates only 18% gdp . We don't need to this many people and most of them are in disguised unemployment anyway

Raising MSP is basically BS and would just worsen the situation . The value of agricultural produce is usually quite low as compared to even other primary activities , this is true everywhere. Raising MSP would just put the government under more financial pressure.

The problem is largely because the land holding are too small . According to google in 2015-16 the average size was 1.08ha.

This is the biggest problem as there is simply no viable way to earn a profit from 1.08ha of normal land and crops.

It maybe possible if the crop is highly valued such as spices , medical herbs , rare or expensive flowers or other cashcrops but these things grow in a select few areas. 4-5ha can earn a decent if not high profit provided use of technology and commercial practices

Therefore the farmers just end up in an endless cycle of debt trap every few years. Small holdings cant earn a profit, the produce from these small lands just goes mostly for subsistence and there is little marketable surplus.

Despite what people say about giving technology etc. It won’t work. It would just put the government in debt instead of the people because of the same reason. These holdings are too small to effectively use technology , these farmers would gain some but still wouldn’t have enough profit to continue maintaining and using modern farming techniques and the same situation would be created.

Not only this but if a large area is controlled by a single person , he can work more efficiently , try more things as well earn enough to purchase technology himself without going into debt

There are only 3 ways I see.

1.      Consolidate the farmers land’s into corporates. I still don’t understand why farmers haven’t realized this . There are very few cooperates in this field , just seeing Mother Dairy or AMUL should have been example enough. The only way to make them do this is literally to use force as most of them are either not educated or unwilling for some stupid reason

 

2.      Encourage growing of more valuable crops wherever possible there is no reason to grow wheat or rice at place where the climate can support more valuable crops . Also by making these  people have more competitive market practices. The best way is to force them to do this by reducing protectionism

 

3.      Simply getting themselves out of agriculture . It is known that they have higher fertility rates. The only thing stopping their kids from acquiring education is their own stubbornness and idiocy. There is no reason to not send one of your 4 kids to school when literally everything related to and used in schools is free for them. They also gain money by just sending their girl child to school under Beti Padhao , Beti Bachao.

 

All in all we need to look beyond these woes and go for the long term using force if necessary. If we don’t this shit will keep repeating every few years. This is not the governments fault , these guys have every facility that maybe needed to get out that situation , it is not our responsibility if they fail to use it.

This includes websites like Hide.me, VPNbook, Hidester etc. all of which are websites that allow the user to mask their location to access information on the internet when the same is blocked in their area.

The principle of Net Neutrality (which not has regulatory backing through license amendments) holds that telecom companies which provide internet access and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are required to treat all data equally, not interfering with the access choices of the end user, and thereby, any providers selective blocking of proxy websites is extremely concerning as it contravenes this principle and regulatory compliance.

Further, with the lack of a codified privacy law in India, blocking VPN sites completely leaves users devoid of any sort of privacy online, which means that any action on a service providers part, takes away a technical protection for one of our most essential fundamental rights. To this end, we are putting out a Google Form to the public. The intention behind this form is to collect data on which websites are being blocked and by which ISPs, after which we will look through it and see how best to remedy the situation, by complaints, approaching Government ministries, regulatory bodies etc.

Possibly the most pathetic company in the country - I'm disgusted at how much they're able to get away with. Shameless people!

About a week ago, I realized that their channel selection page timed out every five minutes and raised a complaint. They took several days to fix the issue. Tried doing it again today - the experience is seriously broken. In fact it is absolutely impossible for someone to complete the process without losing it. They seem to have put something in place just for compliance and are hell bent on swindling the people. Not sure how TRAI lets them get away with this.

# Background

Back in 2016, the principles of Net Neutrality were established in India when the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India prohibited Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services. This effectively prohibited pricing and technical discrimination as offered Facebook’s Free Basics services. In 2018, TRAI further solidified net neutrality in its recommendations which the Department of Telecommunications adopted to make license amendments. However, there have been lasting concerns over the years that largely deal with lack of enforcement of these Rules. This brings us to the current day scenario where we have been witnessing rigorous website blocking by TSP/ISP’s with no legal justification. We have been updating you in our previous [**posts**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-our-net-neutrality-rules-require-a-monitoring-and-enforcement-structure/) of these rampant occurrences.

### ""The Present and Future of Net Neutrality in India""

The Centre for Communication Governance at NLU Delhi and the Internet Freedom Foundation organised an engaging discussion on “The Present and Future of Net Neutrality” this on March 14, 2019 (Thursday) at the India International Centre, Annexe. The reason behind organising such a gathering was to examine Net Neutrality's existing regulations and concerns but more importantly identify the necessary steps forward to protect the spirit and intent of net neutrality. The panellists comprised of experts from government, academia, civil society organisations and industry. Additionally, we have created a report summarising significant aspects of the discussion ([**Read here for more**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vCL0niT1AjiymaxLHHpibuitgCK2es_-/view?usp=sharing)).

&amp;#x200B;

### #SaveTheInternet

As we have explained, over the past few months, the Internet Freedom Foundation has focussed its efforts on identifying the violations of Net Neutrality through blocking of website access. It is in light of these current threats to net neutrality, it has taken the step to activate the [**SaveTheInternet.in**](https://savetheinternet.in/) website on March 18, 2019 at 8:00 AM.  
The website has been designed to move beyond email support for net neutrality to active petitioning. With a direct ""[**Take Action Petition**](https://savetheinternet.in/petition/)"" button, it provides individuals and organisations with the opportunity to show support to list of joint demands sent to the relevant government offices. We continue to make it possible for you to [**submit reports**](https://savetheinternet.in/report/) of any net neutrality violations to us.   
However, the buck does not stop there. We at IFF will continue to monitor violations as we have and to the best of our abilities will ensure the spirit of Net Neutrality is maintained in India. Through this data we will be armed to take advocacy actions, make formal complaints and ensure TRAI and DOT enforce the necessary enforcement mechanisms.

1549072235.0,5,0,16,"&gt; Correct me if any of this is wrong/incorrect.

So before it was kind of like the sites were having stakes in/owned by seller and they made e-commerce very reliable than any local shop seller(where I come from). Just so you know "" ONLY India(few exceptions) got the Pay on delivery service for almost all items(except the costly ones) in the world. 

The middle man in the case of farmers and ecommerce sites is almost same as he will be the one to set the price(its exactly same if you consider amazon basics products). Most local seller will try to cut deals with international sellers which I am sure very less number of sellers from outside India will be interested in. They will try to keep competitive price but it will never be as good as cloudtail or WSRetail.
**It will be just like Downshipping by Local sellers**

**Sort of a solution**: I hope we will get to see companies as sellers for some made in India and other items. China shopping sites are other reliable option if you add paid international shipping to it. They also have priority lines in India now (which is much better than slow India post). I don't have a solution for branded items or customs tax but I hope flipkart and amazon does. Maybe this fiasco will end after the elections. It will be better if people start looking for more options than just indian e-commerce sites.

Eg. I recently bought Mi Box S(global version) around 4300rs which is 7000+ rs on Indian sites like amazon.

### Highlights

* *Context:* The Parliamentary Committee on IT has recently published a notice for a hearing on, ""*‘Safeguarding citizens’ data on social/online news media platforms’""* that will be held on February 11, 2019. This meeting invites representatives of Government and Twitter.
* *Broaden participation:* In line with our past representations when hearings were conducted on data breaches, privacy and to review the functioning of the UIDAI we are asking for greater public participation. This includes oral depositions by experts, academics, domain specialists, technologists and civil society groups.
* *Move towards outcomes:* We also indicate the need for the past hearings on these important subjects to lead towards outcomes. The mandate of the Parliamentary Committee on IT is to make recommendations to Parliment and the work and learnings gathered by depositions and submissions may perish if reports are not prepared and tabled before the next elections.

### Analysis

In continuation in continuation of our letters dated May 21, 2018, April 21, 2018 and April 5, 2018 and a formal memoranda and submissions we made on June 01, 2018 we continue to engage with the Parliamentary Committee on IT. We have today written to the Chairperson, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur and all the Hon'ble Members appreciating the vital role that is played by it in informing the lawmaking process issues of technology and human freedom.

[**Our letter dated February 7, 2019 to the Hon'ble Chairperson and members of the Committee on IT is available here.**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RBebpOEOri-DueBzn-Wxqa_-IAvzkOOt/view?usp=sharing)

In a digitally connected India the committee has assumed vital importance and held hearings on pressing controversies including, net neutrality; data protection and privacy; data breaches and the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and overviewed the functioning of the UIDAI. It's next meeting on February 11, 2019 comes after a representation of[ **allegations of bias of social media companies**](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/twitter-summoned-by-parliamentary-panel-after-anti-right-wing-accusation-1989447), specifically Twitter. Such hearings need to be broader and involve other platforms as well. But most importantly this hearing is correctly titled as, ""safeguarding citizens"" and we believe citizens should play a vital role in it. We believe the public, academic, civil society groups, domain experts and specialists are a vital component of this exercise. They need to be permitted the ability to make oral submissions which are right now restricted only to representatives of Government and Twitter.

Secondly, over the course of the past three years, the breadth of issues considered by the committee have been of vital public importance. However, any outcomes or recommendations which may form a report has not yet been made. As our board chair, Raman Chima has notes on the specific issue of data breaches and the Cambridge Analytica scandal,  ""*a final outcome of this Committee's deliberations on this important topic is also key, to ensure that Parliament remains relevant in how it seeks to protect privacy, rather than being overtaken by developments pushed by the executive and judicial branches of government.*""

We will continue to engage with the committee as firm believers in public victories which are possible through institutional engagement.

1552506771.0,5,2,10,"It was pretty exciting to hear Govt set ambitious disinvestment targets each year, but they were all basically garbage. Why? Because most disinvestment was done as shares buyback, huge dividend payouts and buyouts by other PSUs

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain:

1. Shares Buyback: Basically the PSUs gave money to the govt with very little change in the ownership. It doesnt really accomplish anything. Doesnt encourage private players participation, govt ownership ratio doesnt change drastically, nor increase board transparency. If anything it only worsens because it reduces the money the PSU could have re-invested for business growth or create more job opportunities.
2. Huge Dividend Payouts: The dividends are paid out to every shareholder but majority shares are owned by govt. Again, same reasons as above. There is no real disinvestment here, this was just wacky accounting.
3. Buyout by other PSUs : For example, sale of HPCL to ONGC. Although this wass claimed as a vertical merger, this was not a real merger as HPCL still has its own board and trades separately. Worse even, as HPCL doesn't even recognize ONGC as the promoter and refuses to give it the representation. Again, basically this is a money loot from ONGC and it achieves nothing. I would have liked to see HPCL completely absorbed into ONGC for any benefits of merger, but this dint happen. More transactions like this happened also - Dredging Corp of India and recent PFC-REC buyout.

&amp;#x200B;

Good disinvestments:

1. I think the CPSE ETF tranches and Bharat 22 ETFs were well received.
2. Also, decent # of PSUs were listed on exchanges with some shares: RITES, HUDCO, HAL etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Acceptable:

1. SBI merger with 5 sub banks.
2. IDBI-LIC cash infusion
3. BoB, Dena, Vijaya Bank Merger  


Failures:

1. Air India
2. Pawan Hans
3. Scooters India Limited

&amp;#x200B;

I can only guess that they were scared about public / unions / employees backlash if it was aggressive. But for someone who came in with a huge mandate and seats (probably a rare opportunity in India) they failed to do any meaningful disinvestment. And, whatever they did, it only harmed more as it reduced the PSUs ability to hire and invest more.

For example pool of environment scientists for environment ministry and pool of economists for finance ministry, retd, pool of Army men for defence ministry.
Instead of single person pool of people can be choosed in one ministry having multiple experts who work together democratically (voting on each decision)

We need to keep the tourist places safer for the tourists, especially for the women tourists. Special security forces for the tourist spots are required. Also, they need to use modern security and surveillance systems for better efficiency.

The services like rented cars, restaurants, shops etc should be kept under strict vigilance in tourist zones.

**Highlights**

* *Background:* There have been increasing reports of website blocking by various ISP's all over India. To which we built a crowd-sourced information form encouraging users to report violations of net neutrality they were facing.  
* *Need for an enforcement mechanism*: The main threat to net neutrality is the absence of mechanism that monitors, reports and provide users with a well established redressal process to address violations.

### Background

Owing to a large public movement on Net Neutrality known as SaveTheInternet.in, the Telecom Regulations Authority of India (TRAI) made the, “Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016” which banned zero rated services after much public protest. Further consultations on the issue of technical discrimination led to the TRAI eventually introducing amendments to the Unified License conditions which upheld the intrinsic connection between net neutrality and free speech.

### Need for Action

In our previous posts, we provided information of our analysis of the reports of blockings that we received ([Read here for more](https://savetheinternet.in/blog/what-a-week-updates-from-savetheinternet/)). We also explain why website blocking is a violation of net neutrality [here](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-our-net-neutrality-rules-require-a-monitoring-and-enforcement-structure/). In brief, when any blocking is carried out without direction or order of the Court/Government, it is considered to be discriminatory treatment. Additionally, even if this measure is being engaged, it is necessary that it be done in a manner that is “proportionate, transient and transparent”. Neither of these conditions have been met and have left users with no understanding of the reasons for such blockings or a mechanism for redressal. Hence, in light of the growing intensity of such violations and after seeking advice from external legal counsel, we have made a formal representation to the Department of Telecommunications requesting for certain interim steps to be carried out ([Read here for more](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wS1gUa0nl3YLM2Tlhjpej8l97cZan-yZ/view?usp=sharing)).

* That as an interim solution, investigation into the reports of violation submitted by close to 250 prople, until an enforcement body in line with the recommendations of the TRAI, is set up.
* That the DOT enforce its authority to ask for records/information of compliance by licensors especially with regard to the complaints reported to us.
* That in ensuring deterrance of such violations, necessary fines for breach be considered.

However, these are *just* the initial steps in supporting TRAI's recommendations in creating an enforcement structure for Net Neutrality.

On 20th December 2018, the Cyber and Information Security Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued an order which authorises ten security and intelligence agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource.

We called to attention the risks this poses to our online privacy saying that it enables surveillance without any transparency or oversight. It lacks any meaningful safeguards. These arguments are at the centre of the [**case filed by IFF** ](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-iffs-petition-for-survelliance-reform-saveourprivacy/)which is challenging the legality of the digital surveillance system before the Supreme Court of India.

In order to get to the bottom of this order and do something about it, IFF filed six RTIs seeking answers to the following rather basic questions:

1. How many times has the government used its powers for an interception?
2. How many agencies have been authorized to intercept, monitor or decrypt data?    
3. The names and the directions provided to the abovementioned agencies.
4. Date, time and duration of meetings conducted by the Review Committee.
5. How many times has the government received requests from different agencies seeking interception? Number of requests deniedNumber of requests approved
6. How many times has an order been issued to prevent any offence which affects the sovereignty, integrity, defence or security of the state? Number of times order issued to investigate into an offence

According to us, these are very reasonable queries. They can help us understand how surveillance works in India. How much does the state tap our smartphones? How many times does it ask for our personal data from online companies? Such disclosure can suggest broad operational trends and the implementation of safeguards. Such aggregate data would in no way impact national security.

Well to our disappointment all six RTIs were rejected. The grounds cited are sections 8(1)(a), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act 2005 on the grounds that ‘Disclosure of information related to lawful interception/phone tapping/monitor or decrypt is exempted’. This basically means that the government is unwilling to tell us who has access to all our private data and why they have access to it. If anything this reply confirmed was the complete secrecy and lack of oversight in digital surveillance by the Government of our personal data.

Next steps? We will be filing an appeal against this denial and pursuing these RTIs to their logical conclusion.

We would also like to indicate that RTI Activist, Mr. Venkatesh Nayak (Coordinator, Access to Information, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative) has filed similar RTIs and received a similar rejection. He has recently penned a legal analysis on it [**at the Leaflet**](https://theleaflet.in/computers-intercepted-transparency-interrupted-mhas-cpio-refuses-information-about-december-2018-authorisation-order-under-the-it-act)​.

So during play he asked me have you eaten bhata ki sabji. Being small and an idiot i didn't know what it was and said no. He proceeds to tell that is is very awesome to eat and tasty. And then asks again did you want to eat again. I said yes. I was fairly clueless so he then acted to bring the curry. And brought a stone and told me that the curry is here. I was confused?? . It was during summer holidays. I was confused the entire summer then I asked my mother what ""Bhata"" is she told me it was stone and loled out. She laughed so much that it became her favourite thing to ask me for several years. It was bad.

1546849743.0,8,5,12,"So for past many years we have been seeing multiple advertisements for cooking oils which targeted heart and other cardiovascular health related concerns for advertising their products. They have shown women deep frying samosas for their husbands in respective brands because they care about their husband's heart. They have shown husbands failing to jog without losing their breath because they started using certain brand of oil and now husband's stamina has multiplied by 3.

&amp;#x200B;

But suddenly, maybe a week or two it seems like cooking oil brands have suddenly shifted from heart to stomach. They have started advertising the well being of stomach to advertise their product. I don't recall the brand, but yes there is one advertise running it. But what caught my attention was one shitty marathi serial on Zee Marathi had product placement for some cooking oil brand with required targeting. 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize the serial, the leading female protagonist is owner of a company worth Rs. 300CR only while her husband is cheating on her with much younger &amp; beautiful gold digger girl. So this leading lady is cooking in her kitchen with certain brand of oil and her mom-in-law walks in and asks about change in brand. To which the lady goes that this oil keeps stomach healthy and keeps heath problems related to stomach away. \*Insert brand name while facing camera and respective catchphrase\*

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure, other brands making cooking oil must have started producing advertisements targeting stomach and in few weeks our TV programmes will be flooded with them.

1551773123.0,8,51,49,"My experience with Swiggy over the last few months has been pathetic. Horrible, horrible company.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, their 'deals' are usually a scam. Many of their restaurants list their menu prices on Swiggy while calling it a discount. It is their duty as an aggregator to correct this behaviour - which they do nothing about.

&amp;#x200B;

Further, theres a higher than 50% chance I will get the wrong order. 

&amp;#x200B;

My worst experience was when there were numerous items missing from my order and they did not refund or replace but issued a coupon for 1/5th the value of the food. That is called THEFT.

&amp;#x200B;

They claim that 'missing items/wrong items is the restaurants fault'. Hey, idiots, I am paying YOU not the restaurant. It is YOUR FAULT and YOU are responsible.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst is their 'customer support team' aka 'bunch of baboons at a keyboard'.

&amp;#x200B;

All they do is copy paste apologies, saying 'we assure you this will not happen again', and then it ALWAYS happens again.

&amp;#x200B;

Asked how I can speak to a manager, and the last SIX executives I spoke to kept ignoring the question, replying with irrelevant nonsense, then closing the chat.

&amp;#x200B;

This cesspool of a disgusting, charlatan company should be boycotted completely.

1550377645.0,8,28,89,"I recently heard this news that one of my friends has got placed in Cognizant. *Woah, great news*, I congratulated him and conversation continued. He told,

&gt;*I'm going to Cognizant Internship on Weekdays, and on Weekends he's on Delivery duty with Zomato.*

Out of Curiosity, I told him if I could join him on a day in delivery here in Chennai and go on Deliveries with him. Here's a short compiled list of things that I learnt from, and I would like to pen them down for you.

## So, here you go,

* When asked, why did he chose to be a Delivery guy, his answer was pretty much straight saying, "" I was bored in the room and couldn't stay"", so chose this to keep himself busy.
* The next reason that he stated was the amount he was earning, he goes to intern at Cognizant from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, sometimes longer **every day** for a month. But he earns Rs. 12,000 INR but same time spend on this delivery services get him Rs. 40,000 INR per month, depending upon the orders he delivers. Later, when he got busy with Cognizant, he chose to do it on Weekends.
* He was very conscious that Job at Cognizant is secure and scalable down the line in next 3 - 5 years, while working a delivery guy is not.
* He intentionally asked his dad that, to drop him an amount fixed of Rs. 6000 INR in his account. Anything beyond the expenses of Rs. 6000, he would take from his own earned savings.
* He spent the initial amount from his friend, to get a Pre-owned Bike. Which he later turned into his own in 2 weeks of full-day service on Zomato.
* He's very much clear and passionate about doing some business and is definitely on this way. While Job acts something secure for his parents &amp; the society.
* He also has one of his colleague in Zomato who also works Cognizant and earns Rs. 1,50,000 INR per month. But, he joined Zomato along.

## While that was very pretty much about him, and his experience with the delivery goes this way,

* On December 31, 2018, he wasn't actually ready or in a mood to enjoy the new year. Zomato app for Delivery guys was pretty much easy, they just have to **toggle between online/offline.**
* So, he just kept his phone online, and got an Order that late night, and exactly at 12:01 AM he went on to the doorstep to deliver the order.

&gt;*""The customer, took the order, shared me the new year cake &amp; hugged me. Also, showed me so much gratitude.""*

* This guy was special, since he was pretty much familiar with technology than the other uneducated delivery guys, he used to understand the exact address &amp; map locations. The best part was, **he only does doorstep delivery**, no matter it's on 4-5 floor Apartment.
* If the phones go below 20% of charge, the app doesn't work. Once set 'Online', the app takes the complete control over the phone. You cannot turn the phone off or put it in silent mode, soon.
* Sometimes they have classes. They are taught to wear shoes and behave politely.
* Zomato only allows you to become a delivery for one particular Region who you chose to deliver to. You cannot go beyond that.
* All their batch take Group Photos when they wait near a restaurant and have their own WhatsApp group. He's a Batch POC to remaining 22 members of his batch. (Similar to Class Representative in Colleges :P)
* There are few people, who think they'll get more orders to deliver if he waits for nearest to the computer of the manager in the restaurant he's waiting in. That sounds funny, but it is true. More orders are like more marks.

**How do you get an order that has to be delivered on mobile?**

""I need to toggle to Active mode, once that's done as soon as some order is ready for me to get it delivered, the restaurant owner and I will get a screen asking to accept the order. I need to swipe it. Then I have to go to the Restaurant owner to get an OTP and enter in my app. (Which basically says the customer, the Delivery boy has reached the restaurant) Once swiped, Order details will appear to get the food to deliver."" he said.

**Do you know who is the CEO of Zomato is?**

**""I don't know who CEO is, (laughs), but if you ask the same to my colleagues here on service waiting along with others on they don't even know what 'CEO' is!""** *That said, I've asked him an irrelevant question, maybe.*

**Share me one interesting incident that happened with you?**

""Once there was one of us, who took a U-Turn in the wrong direction. It was Delivery boy's mistake. But when police caught him, all the delivery boys in that area joins to please the officer to leave him. The interesting part is, it just takes on WhatsApp message in the group, and all the guys in the batch will turn their **Active status off** and suddenly, no delivery boy will be available to serve customers.""

## Safety

Well that being said, for any delivery guys the biggest nightmare while they go on a delivery is Safety. Of course, I've experienced that part to. We were going calm straight, and suddenly met with an accident.

We were probably lucky enough that we didn't go with any serious injuries, but just a few minor ones.

So here's a picture of the bike that's damaged. - **Removed**

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like something serious happened.

## Finally,

After learning so much from him, here's what I just said what I want to,

*""I really love the values you hold, You are very much conscious and practical about the life and now, you already took action to build it the right way, while there are millions fail pick. I see you also have personal targets to save money and measure your success by the amount of money you make. While that's quite a good practical metric, there's also my last piece of advice for you. Money is only a need &amp; business is what you want to do. Figure out Why you want to do anything you plan for.""*",t5_2qh1q,A day out with Zomato friend on Delivery,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/arh2rt/a_day_out_with_zomato_friend_on_delivery/
1549521646.0,8,31,27,"I came across this ELI5 topic where u/mredding posted the following :-

It's not, the slogan, ""Breakfast is the most important meal of the day,"" was invented in the mid 19th century by Seventh Day Adventists James Caleb Jackson and John Harvey Kellogg to sell their newly invented breakfast cereal food stuffs. Yes, that Kellogg. Then the bacon market jumped on that bandwagon, got 5,000 doctors to sign off on the health benefits of eating protein in the morning, and got news papers to publish the signatories as though it were scientific research.

It was all founded on bullshit. It was a weird time, where people were moving into factories and people were getting all up about indigestion. Kellogg was also weird about the morality of breakfast and thought bland food would curb masturbation. If you look into this period, it gets weirder than that. I blame all the lead and mercury in the water. That shit makes you dumb and fucking crazy.

This is obviously highlighting the situation in the West. But how about in India? Did we always have a breakfast culture?

EDIT : Why are you guys so triggered and abusive. Ok I may have an unpopular opinion but you can simply deny if you don't agree with me or at least try to bring up valid strong points on why can't govt do that. I'm not implying that I'm right, I'm just pointing out the possibilities

The problem with today's people is that for them an unpopular opinion is simply a conspiracy theory / traitor


Some of the guys here simply don't know what a civil discussion and debate is.

EDIT : removed the political content.

EDIT : What I said in removed content is that don't let any party to take advantage of this situation in coming elections. There will be people saying that this was an inside job and there will be people saying that we took your revenge (if another cross border operation happens). We all know what happened in 84. Everything is possible but for now just don't let anyone feed profit from this.

DO NOT let anyone take political leverage out of this.

Also this is what I think how could we defeat Pakistan:

We alone can't. Period. Pakistan is like your local gully goon who is backed by his vidhayak chacha(USA/UAE/PRC etc).
Those countries just give a Facebook message or tweet or speech that they condemn such behavior but continue business relationship and funding.

India should ASAP deny pak all business relationship/import/export/aids etc. Killing 20-30 puny soilders won't do anything. Go for the queen, go for the head. If USA and China understand that they are feeding a cancer and stop their transactions  Pakistan will be royally fucked in quarter of an year. They'll be literally begging on their knees in a condition far worse than any war could do.

But they won't. Because it's not their job or problem. We have to take first action. Juck make them untouchable. Fucking bycott Pakistan. No aid,no import,export, transport, sports nothing. Appel internationally to do the same. Appeal your allies to bycott Pakistan too.  Eventually we'll have an international group who support this. Small but effective.

This way we'll be hitting their head. Direct War and strike will just kill normal people, and poor fauzis who are just following orders. Strangle them the above way and eventually their own population will rebel them.",t5_2qh1q,"Nukes aren't a solution, it's suicide.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aqtye5/nukes_arent_a_solution_its_suicide/

1550478315.0,2,34,122,"Today, that is on 18th february, 2019 I got a call at 10:30 AM from alleged paytm employees from their call centers saying I had won a lucky draw and I can choose any out of five, very expensive products, which were a refrigerator, AC, LED TV, a dell laptop and a iphone 7 . The very first thing that came in my mind was that, this has to be a scam. But the alleged paytm employee whose name she says as 'Pooja' managed to not only tell me my registered mobile number which I had used to create an account on paytm, but also my entire residential address !

&amp;#x200B;

But, I was still suspicious, so I humored her for a bit and then told her I was unsure which product I wanted and was it possible to call them afterwards, she obliged by saying yes, but told me to call in an hour. In that time, I decided to google recent paytm call center scams, and this one resembled my experience word for word :- [https://consumercomplaintscourt.com/fraud-call-in-the-name-of-paytm-mall/](https://consumercomplaintscourt.com/fraud-call-in-the-name-of-paytm-mall/)

&amp;#x200B;

I then called them back, recorded the entire conversation this time, wherein they also said that they are not giving the product completely for free, but I have to first login to my paytm account and then buy a 5000 rupees product, and then I can have my desired gadget.

I hope you spread this message, especially to our older, not so tech- savvy population\[mostly, I guess\] as nobody should fall for these deplorable scams.

I do not know whether this is a paytm leak, or they sold customer information willingly to third parties, but this is just disturbing, to say the least .

1553709154.0,2,40,33,"In the past few years, a disturbing trend has become part of historical conversations. People, often lacking any actual background in Indian history, criticise Gandhiji for reasons that are not even factually correct. They believe that Gandhi had little to no effect on the Indian Independence movement and that he colluded with the British, although there is no significant evidence for either claim.

There are a few possible reasons for this. For more than half a century, Indians have believed that Gandhiji was a saint, quite aptly called a Mahatma. However, this portrayal of Gandhiji has proved to be rather counter-productive. The people were bound to be disillusioned by this image as he was only a man. Sadly, though, this disillusionment has come with a vengeance. People have suddenly jumped to the opposite end of the spectrum. This change in sentiment is due, in no small part, to the RSS and the venom that the organization spews through its members. There's also the disillusionment brought about by age. People tend to believe less and less in idealistic principles like Satya and Ahimsa as they grow older, instead believing in some sort of ""direct action"".

Many people place Bhagat Singh and Netaji Bose on a higher pedestal. While I do understand that their ideologies might be rather attractive, neither of them had a sustainable vision for India. Bhagat Singh believed in a strictly Socialist state, even leaning towards anarchism and Communism. His ideals of violent action would have brought more evil than good. Subhash Chandra Bose on the other hand committed a great folly asking for help from the Imperialist Japanese. It's hard to imagine what he expected. The Japanese free India from the British and then? They just hand it over? If the Japanese had not turned back from the North-East, we would probably have to fight a second War for Independence. This is, however, not to downplay the roles of either of them in the Independence movement. Every single one of the freedom fighters was a brave Indian and gave what they believed the country needed, and I deeply respect every one of them for it.

There are several criticisms of Gandhi. Some legitimate, some not so much. We could discuss any criticism you guys want to put forth. I just made this post because my heart sinks whenever I look at Facebook comment sections with people uttering absolute falsehoods against Gandhiji simply because they've bought into the propaganda around them. I couldn't just stay quiet anymore.

1547457055.0,2,7,6,"On the [Wikipedia page on the kalyuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga#Attributes_of_Kali_Yuga), there is a mention of the Mahabharata a lot of points presented seem to resonate with what's going on the world around me.

&gt;Rulers will become unreasonable: they will levy taxes

This one is obvious.

&gt;Rulers will no longer see it as their duty to promote spirituality, or to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world.

All the strife happening in various parts of this planet bear testimony to this.

&gt;People will start migrating, seeking countries where wheat and barley form the staple food source.

Mass emigration from Northern Africa and Arabian countries to Europe is a thing.

&gt;Avarice and wrath will be common. Humans will openly display animosity towards each other. Ignorance of dharma will occur.

We do this. All the time. In our own country at that.

&gt;Lust will be viewed as socially acceptable and sexual intercourse will be seen as the central requirement of life.

Reddit's echochamber resonates with this loudly.

&gt;Sin will increase exponentially, while virtue will fade and cease to flourish.

Amit Shah, Donald Trump et al can do whatever the fuck they want.

&gt;Women will no longer get married.

Fertility rates are going down and marriage ages are going up.

&gt;Traditional castes will disappear and everyone will belong to a single social class.

&gt;Brahmins will not be learned or honored, Kshatriyas will not be brave, Vaishyas will not be just in their dealings, and the varna system will be abolished.

In our own country, we are calling for this.

Now, I'm not saying that all of this is necessarily a bad thing. I just find it rather hard to believe that a document written thousands of years ago over a duration ranging from a few centuries to one millennium is accurately able to predict the state of this planet during this point of time.

I have not actively analysed the contents, and I have limited knowledge of Indian history to draw from, but something is really weird. Shit like this gives ammunition to those who would like to go back to the supposed good ol' days of the Vedas.

1546945877.0,2,77,72,"I remember my grandfather taking his own sweet time to shave his beard. He never seemed to hate shaving. I had a Gillette pro glide fusion that i used before. The cartridges are expensive and the blades go blunt after the first few shaves. I hated shaving which did impact the way i looked.

I recently started wet shaving and the difference is huge!. Its much skin friendly( No razor bumps). It hurts less after shaving and most importantly it makes me want to shave everyday.

I used to spend 1.2k for an 8 cartridge pack, which lasted for like 3 months (AT BEST). After moving to wet shaving, the blade cost is so low. I get 100 blade pack of Astra platinum blades for 1k, which i can use for a year if i used one blade for three shaving sessions (Definitely i can use one blade for longer). Even better value is supermax blade which costs 350 rs for 100 pack. Its hell lot of value and you can save and spend em on something else.

It has a bit of learning curve. Just do not give up after doing it once. Check out youtube videos on how to wet shave. People do it effortlessly.

I would suggest watching this :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps88RU_BXlA

The initial investment will be a bit huge or dead cheap depending on what razor you buy. Parker is made in India company that makes Quality razors and its highly regarded worldwide and available on amazon if not locally. Romer razors are inexpensive. The difference is that blade angles dont need to be adjusted in expensive ones because the razor is precise to its micrometer length for any blade. A razor is a long term investment.

**Something in it for environment :**

It's hard to recycle a combination of metal + plastic. Gillette razors and cartridges are not enviroment friendly. Gillette doesn't sell DE razors anymore.

Here's the make in india products i bought and I would suggest this for starters.

Parker 24c open comb razor

This can affect us severely and there are high chances of heat stroke and other illnesses. However, we humans can go in shade, avoid going out during afternoons and have many other things to keep ourselves hydrated.

Birds and animals, unfortunately, are not able to do it. They go through a lot and try to save themselves from extreme sun. Many die due to dehydration.

&amp;#x200B;

The least we can do is make some water arrangements for when (with regular refills) so that they are able to cope up with high temperatures.

1548163505.0,2,18,33,"Hi reddit folks,
   Using a throwaway for this. I'm(24F) stuck in a rut and trying to find some help/advice here. I had an ok-paying job in an awesome city (Bangalore,India). Then I got an admit to a good bschool and will be pursuing my mba in a couple of months. And so, I had left my job  a month ago because I(..and pretty much everyone except my bad manager) felt it was a dead end job where I knew I would be stagnant. I wanted to start fresh reset my mind before I go to bschool.
I moved cities and moved into my parents house in Chennai. Its been one month and everything has taken a bad turn. My parents have their own issues. I feel like I maybe burdening them, though they say I am not. I thought I had a plan before coming here, an internship. Something. I am feeling lonely without my office friends. I have started double thinking everything in my life. Mainly my career and my love life(failed 2 attempts). My diet got messed up. I stopped going to the gym. In Bangalore, I got past my comfort zone to actually set a proper diet and go running every day for 5 days a week. I travelled. Now all that has gone to shit. When I came back to Chennai I went to my dad's gym and trained with a trainer there. I was on trial and given my base fitness I really loved the training here, even the trainer would take an interest in training me. But sometime after a week I had stopped. My trainer asks my dad what happened to me. My dad has to manage saying my health's bad. I have put on weight and have gone backwards to that mindset of ' too out of shape to go to the gym'. 
Career wise. I graduated as an Engineer. Shortly after became a graphic designer while simultaneously going for weekend acting classes as I wanted to be an actor. All this before I joined the IT services sector as I had got an on campus job offer.
Now that I am back and jobless before I go to bschool, I feel empty. Not aware as I left the newspaper reading habbit(used to love reading livemint/the economist). Seems like I don't know what I want anymore. I don't know what interests me anymore. I don't know what to do these 3-4 months! Added to this I really don't know what career path I want to take. This is all disappointing knowing I learn pretty much anything pretty quickly. My ex-team members liked me and my work and I had some purpose(though that was short lived, before I knew the job was dead end, no growth kinda job). Quite a few of my friends/colleagues have left the team with better job offers in hand. I am no where utilising my time or, mostly, my skills. I feel shitty.

Each day is a day of wastage. No excercise, overeating or skipping meals. Only 2 Coursera courses to keep me engaged. No social life. Fed up in the house. Yet everyone's telling me how precious these 4 months are and I shouldn't waste them. I wanted to travel elsewhere, far from home(northeast India) and stay there for 3 months. But with no job, my savings won't be enough to sail through. I don't want to borrow money from my parents and they take it on ego that I think their money is different from my money.

I need some help here. I'm pretty much going mad without venting it out to my family/anywhere. Hence I'm here.
Can you people help me. Advice. Anything at all.

Its a long post. Thank you for reading this!

We WILL NOT use Adhaar, no matter how much convenience we have to sacrifice, until Modi makes us by making it illegal to use any other ID, plain and simple.

I haven't been in a very long relationship ever because I belong to a conservative household. The longest I ever dated a girl was 1 month. Whereas, her parents are very cool.

While speaking to each other one day I found out that she has been in 4 relationships so far and she's had sex with 7 people and doesn't have any count on the number of times she's done it.

Now after knowing this I feel so insecure about my sexual inexperience. I feel like I haven't done anything fun in my life. I have had sex just once.

Not bragging or trolling. I am really insecure about it and it's affecting our relationship. Please give me serious replies only.

**Translation in italics for non-Hindi speakers:**

Ravish recites a couple of poems about laughter. *These poems bring to mind a recent incident of sickening laughter. A laughter about an illness that was heard by the whole nation. In the midst of students from IIT Kharagpur, a girl student asked a question on dyslexia and the Prime Minister tried to capitalise on it to make a political joke. Since then many reactions have been pouring in - reactions not from politicians, but from those who understand the pain of suffering from dyslexia, and from those who understand the duty of every student to ask questions. Teachers are writing about what the students' reaction should have been to such a laughter, and students are writing about what they felt about this laughter.*


The clip of the PM making those remarks.

*A sensitive question, an insensitive laughter, and after a moment, the burst of laughter from all around the classroom. The PM may have achieved his political goal by those remarks, but he was alienated himself completely to the anguish of sufferers of this disabillity who were searching for balm to sooth their pain.* 

The narrator then explains what dyslexia is and how it affects people.

*We know a lot about this disability, but we don't understand the pain of those who suffer from it. The student who tried to tell the PM about her project must've been expecting PM to take her work seriously, but the PM made a joke of it and the other students laughed. Rohit Kumar, addressing the students who laughed as to what they should've done, has written in an article for The Wire, 'I don't know if the student whom the PM was conversing with really wanted to laugh. Her laugh was not a bully's laugh. My decades working in educational fields has given me a good sense of the bully's laugh. It's a cruel and easy laughter that usually springs from the mockery of the weak and helpless. In my mind, hers was a nervous laughter.'*


The narrator says, *Rohit Kumar has written that he has watched the video multiple times and he was dumbfounded that such a thing was said by his country's Prime Minister.* 


Rohit continues, *'I feel it took a while for the joke to dawn on the minds of you all who were in that room, but the guffawing that followed were extremely saddening. I expected much more from the students of such a premier institute, but I guess becoming in an expert in science and mastering the technical things doesn't make you a good citizen.'* 

The narrator continues, *When a bully mocks the weak, it's easy to get carried along and join in, that's how a mob is formed. If you are sensitive and are trying to not be part of such a mob, then such laughter should trouble you. We shoul also look at the PM's remarks from the perspective of someone who is suffering from this illness. A 15 year old girl has written a message to the PM in Times of India.* 

The girl writes to Modi, *'Do you have any clue as to what I have to go through? Society just pities me and moves on, and politicians don't understand anything.* 

The narrator then says, *It's obvious that PM Modi, who often gives children tips on how to face exams, has failed a big test himself. By making a serious discussion about a serious and painful disease the punchline to a joke, [the PM] has shown that he is not serious about this subject. But the victims of this disability have pointed to another troubling aspect: if kids suffering from dyslexia need any slackening of the rope during exams, they have to give a certificate of disability from the All India Speech and Hearing Institute. They have to give many kinds of tests, and every year they have to produce this certificate.  Kids say they have to waste two months of the year for this procedure. They feel insulted by this is an added problem.* 

The lady explains how dyslexia is a hidden disability and because of that parents find it difficult to accept that there's anything wrong. 

The narrator concludes, *This is a serious problem, and people are looking for solid solutions, but what they get is a careless laugter. If only someone could make the PM experience the anguish of these children.*

---

I translated this to the best of my ability. I've translated the words 'dabang' as 'bully' and 'viklangata praman patra' as 'certificate of disability' from the context, I don't actually understand these words, so if I'm wrong, please let me know.",t5_2qh1q,Ravish Kumar's excellent segment on PM's dyslexia comments,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ayu9cl/ravish_kumars_excellent_segment_on_pms_dyslexia/

Even some golden movies like DDLJ were uninteresting to me/never seen it so I thought maybe I like hollywood or other countries' movies because of the big budget, foreign feel with new things, great VFX, use of English and what not but honestly those things were secondary or external factors. It was mostly about great acting, good cinematography, the way they create private real life moments in front of camera, the way they live in those moments.

It's been nearly half century for the beginning of indian movies and we have nothing but few movies which were amazing attempt to sell new ideas making it worth a while eg. Swades,Dil Chahta hai and few others . Real was always rare in our movies and there was hardly any effort to move ahead of keeping love as focus or end goal.

Average movies also create average critics and also average or below average actors who make their whole career based on it being loved by average fans following. Honestly instead of porn ban we should had shitty movie ban which sells the idea of objectifying woman and normalize forcing love on some random person till they accepts it and yes these affects people as you can already see how people think beloved celeb personality is same as they are in their movies. All and all I  want to say it, 2018 was amazing leaving me hope for bollywood but nepotism still exists, my sister told me that the role of female lead in Simba(another average movie) was signed by a acting reality show winner but then was replaced by Saif Ali Khan's daughter.

There are some amazing underrated critics like Film Companion(Sucharita), Cinema Beyond Entertainment,Stutee Ghosh from the Quint,Mensutra(maybe)  and with the end of nepotism, I wonder how much Bollywood will improve with new quality actors and their creations.",t5_2qh1q,Just a thought about Bollywood after seeing recent Indian movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/abgu95/just_a_thought_about_bollywood_after_seeing/

Note:-Unlike from the Newspaper articles given in the net, this is ""from"" the person who wrote it and what Many many had told...

This is related to the Science stream..

It all started on February 5th and we did not get enough time for revising or so ...Let me start from the practical section....

*Physics Practicals (Feb 5)-The experiments were easy. Almost everyone got the correct answer and the procedure part was typed in a simple way and everyone were satisfied...

*Chemistry Practicals (Feb 7)-This was easier than physics. Everything was balanced...No one found it difficult to get the confirmation tests..

*Biology Practicals (Feb 11)-The questions were of an easy pattern...The identification of specimens were not hard and the physiological experiments were also easy....

*Computer Practicals (Feb 13)-I'm a Bio student,so, with what i have heard, the Practicals were easy..

Now the fun begins...

*Computer Theory(Feb 18)-For many students the paper was easy...but for some ,output questions were hard. The K map and programs were easy by the way...(Said by a trust worthy source)

*English Grammar (Feb 21)-Although some grammar questions were a bit tricky but, question paper was overall very easy.The passages were silly but they essay choices very good.

*English Literature (Feb 25)-The Tempest was easy.. However, the short stories from""Echoes"" had dull selection... It compressed of 1 dull chapter and two philosophical stories.. The poems from""Reverie"" had a slightly better choice as it had one simple poem and two philosophical poems.. students actually did not expect this dull paper...

*Chemistry Theory (Mar 1)-This had a slightly unusual question paper ...the questions were somewhat different from the previous year types ,the numerical section was easy... the inorganic was kinda easy but they give more equations in organic section. The students actually did not expect some type of questions to be found here. Many did find it difficult... The most common review is, ""Just Satisfactory""... This paper was negatively reviewed by many students...

*Maths (Mar 5)- Sigh , this was the hardest Maths question paper CISCE has sent since idk....many many years i think.... The question paper was lengthy, the questions were harder... Many were not able to finish on the correct given time. Section A was hell for....many section B was kind of moderate while section C (which was mainly for the commerce) was much more easier...students had high hopes for this one but it was ultimately lead to a disaster... After all the exams which we are faced,this was the most negative received exam paper... For many, their dreams were shattered..

Analysis:-this year's question papers where harder than the previous years... Many had hopes, which lead to an utter disappointment... The chemistry and maths qp actually played with everyone... This was not a ""SATISFACTION""EXAM!!!

I actually have no idea what these ISC people are doing. Just making the question paper hard does not make a good standard. It's like the ISC people are trying to be the CBSE board. if this trend continuous for the coming exams and for the coming years,I don't think there would be anyone left to study for the ISC.Then, people would opt for CBSE or any local syllabuses... The main reason which people choose ISC was ""JUST"" .because they were studying in ICSE in the 10th standard. Now they are making fun with your lives.. it's like making all these 14 years go to the trash... And since India is a highly competitive country,the Board marks will surely affect those who are aspiring for high colleges...it has made thousands of parents lose their hope for the child and the pupils also have lost their hope for the coming exams and the ISC is doing a great job in that.

I don't know who is actually the wrong here...IS it the teachers who has not trained the students properly with proper methods of teaching and proper revision?????? Or is it just us who did not study properly for this board exam???? Or is it just council who is trying to bring a change in the ""Standard""of the paper????whatever it maybe it is just messing with our lives. And like common people ask ""what will you do without having good marks?""which is our situation... Demotivation is Never A Factor for Quality...

Based on the reviews of many,here is my rating of each subject in their difficulty level..

Computer Theory-1.5/5

English Grammar-1.75/5

English Literature-2.5/5

Chemistry-3.5/5

Maths-3.75/5

Note:-this is just the average ranking which I made after reviews from many many students... Personal ranking might be different, but, this is just a summation... I earlier did post this but, had to remove due to some problems... Thanks for spending your time reading this and share your thoughts... It took me some time too....

1547728620.0,2,53,54,"Take my word for this (or don't, who am I to tell you what to do anyways), but when you are dying and all of your life is flashing right before your very eyes, your fancy degrees and your ""package"" and how many people you slept with will matter very, very little to you. What will instead matter instead is **how well you treated others.** What will matter is how many awesome experiences you packed in your life without worrying about what ""society"" or some other outsider would think/feel about it. What will matter is how much of your time you were able to give to your loved ones. It won't matter to you how much money you are having at that point in time or how many awards and certificates you've won in your life or the number of PhDs in your folder or whatever else of that shit there is. Not saying that money is bad or anything (because that's just some legit BS); but that you won't really be clinging on to any of that stuff while you're awaiting your end.  

It pains me to see how so many of us still take these things for granted and are still measuring our own self-worth because of what ""level of respectability in society"" we were able to achieve or not achieve. And I've seen this a lot on Quora particularly. And no, you can keep your IQ certificates at home if you are a dick to people because the latter is what will truly hurt YOU the most when you're dying. And yes, you WILL come to that painful realization at such a time, no matter how much of a bully or asshole you had been in your life.

These insights come not only from my own near encounter with death which I thankfully survived, but also of **[countless others](https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/exceptional.html)** who have been saying these things **[over and over and over again endlessly.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying)**  

Take it from a guy who has escaped death by a whisker, you'll remember even a tiny smile that you gave a stranger and made their day with - with great joy. And that you'll remember the angry words that you said to someone who cares for you in a moment of heated argument with deep, deep regret.  

And if any of you are wondering, no, I'm not high as I'm writing this stuff. I wish you a great day/week/fortnight/month/year/decade/century ahead. Cheers! :)  

**EDIT 1:** No, I do not wish to make you feel all regretful and remorseful about your life. That is NOT the intent and the purpose of this post. I only wish to serve as a reminder, a ""wake-up call"" if you will, to all of you that you ALL can ALWAYS change for the better starting RIGHT NOW. We can't go back in the past and change things. But we sure can start NOW with the intention to do things better this time, can we not? And PLEASE don't think of any act you do as ""too tiny"", ""too trivial"" or ""too pointless"". You can smile at someone and make their day and add positive vibes into the whole world. You can help someone with a tiny task on Reddit with a single comment and assist them SO MUCH. You can share a link to your favourite song and who knows, but that song's lyrics could well go on to uplift someone out of their misery. So PLEASE don't ever underestimate what you can do, for you can do a WHOLE LOT. I hope that this helps.

I started with Beer and i suppose it was a mistake. It was fucking horrible. The taste wanted me to throw up anytime and i don't know what happened, i jumped from Beer to Scotch, Whisky and Rum. All were horrible in taste and i cannot perceive why people like them so much. Only difference was the degree of shittiness. 

Nevertheless, i got to experience what really happens when your Body meets alcohol. I felt lightheaded but nothing sort of the television drunk illustration. Anyway, i woke up to a slight headache. 

Review- Party was worth it and at least i completed on of the tasks in my to-do list but Alcohol isn't some sort of magical drink which you would fall in love with it. Beer is fucking pathetic.

I've been told that manufacturing in China will reduce my costs substantially. But I've honestly no clue about his. I'm just a regular dude that decided to make a toy.

Can someone walk me thru this? My questions, to be specific, are:


1. Will I need to meet manufacturers in China in person or will a middleman be available in India? 


2. Protecting my intellectual property seems silly to even think about. How does one protect their business from chinese knock offs?


3. I'll probably need to pay import tax as well. For a small production capacity, wont I be able to get manufacturing done in India?

I am not a very social person, although I don't hesitate to talk  to new people but I would prefer to be alone or with people I feel connected/comfortable with. And on then  other hand I am preparing for an exam so it's better for me to finish the work and go home without taking coffee break 2 times a day(I don' even  drink coffee because I deem unhealthy) .

So this week a guy took me to coffee area so that I could take a break, I don't know why I complied.

So we were total 2 girls and 3 guys, talking about the nonsense stuff - places to visit, items they are eyeing online, good old bitching (man I hate that) etc. I was quite and phased out (I was on my mobile too).

(In college I had two close friends with whom I could talk on any topic, taking any stand and forgetting about it the next day . )

I don't know when did the topic change and one girl asked me if I would reject a girl based on her drinking/smoking habits. I promptly replied yes. She frowned and questioned ""Seriously ?"". I said yes , as a non drinker and non smoker I would prefer the one who doesn't either. 

Then that dumb bitch accused me of being misogynist &amp; sexist, and provided the analogy I am the same kind of person who want a  virgin girl just coz they are virgin too and doesn't support the their choice  of working after marriage. I tried to explain that she can't equate those two scenarios, but to no avail. Others didn't say much but were on her side with the argument that's it's the girl's choice and should be allowed to follow her choices, blah blah. Didn't want to argue any more, we just wounded up and left.

I might be on the wrong side but I learnt a imp lesson today, that never go on fuckin coffee break.

1550289254.0,2,149,2247,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 

Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):

    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)

CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 

The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).

CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay &amp; perks. 

&gt;A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience

&gt;“We’re like a body,” he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. “Just because the heart is more important, you can’t ignore the knee.”

CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 

&gt;Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.

They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.

&gt; Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".

TL;DR:

We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 

But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

Alcohol : 2-3 times a week

Smoking : 2-3/daily

1552999412.0,2,165,4,"I've always felt that I was right wing ever since I became an atheist 5 years ago. I agreed with most of the people here that there needs to be a serious talk about the muslim community, and instead of appeasement politics there needs to be real reform coming from within the community itself to fix our issues ranging from extremism to illiteracy.

However, when I came to the right wing a lot of what I've seen is that there seems to be very little nuance here as to what the solution of our problems is as a nation. Just recently when Nas. shah made some comments, people started spouting out the most vicious vitriol towards him. People regularly call Javed Akhtar a pakistani here, and any comments from such agnostic muslims is always met with this word in bold: TAQIYYA.

​

Growing up in a fairly moderate muslim family, I can honestly say I've never heard of this phrase in my life. When I asked my parents, they didn't know about it either. I had to google to find out what it actually meant.

​

So here's some clarification which I feel the saner voices of this group might be able to appreciate. Most Indian muslims I've known in my life have been the most liberal and non practicing out of all other muslim nationalities. Most Indian muslims get offended if you call them pakistanis because it's actually offensive considering we actually like the fact that we're Indians and not pakis. Most Indian muslims practice their own version of Islam, and most of them have cognitive dissonance in that area. But most people in the right wing keep criticizing muslims with such intense and deep rooted anger that I feel like even though I agree with most policies of the right wing, I could never belong here.

​

There are people who bash muslim superstitions with such intensity, but completely shut down when you question their superstitious beliefs. I don't know if it's willful ignorance or they've just been misinformed about how muslims think.

​

Ofcourse I can't speak accurately as to how Indian muslims feel because I haven't been one for a while, and this is just anecdotal. But as someone who's probably been more victimized by his religion at birth than most people in the right wing, I can clarify any genuine questions you might have and open some dialogue. I'll try not to be biased in any way, although rooting out bias 100% is impossible for any human being.

This is a huge problem with the state of public discourse in India. Maybe even the world but that is not relevant to us.The lack of nuance while discussing any community. Coming from a religious muslim household I've never heard the term manu smriti or anything written in it discussed ever in my life but manu smriti is thrown at me because I'm an indian living in india. Every christian is seen as a bible thumping evangelist who hates hinduism. Every muslim is seen as a radical islamist. Goes beyond religions too. Anyone who doesn't absolutely detest and spew vitriol on modi is a sanghi, bhakt, gaumutra drinker bigot. Anyone who criticizes modi is a leftist and a naxal. Every tamilian is a separatist who wants to secede. Every maharashtrian is a bigot who beats up biharis.

Now there are definitely a small vocal percentage of these communities who fit these categories but victimizing the rest of the community with this brush and attacking them constantly forces them to get defensive and take an extremist position even if they aren't otherwise.

I suspect a lot of these opinions come from an internet generation whose only exposure to the community they're spewing hatred towards is the internet where they hang out in their bubble and constantly read only of the extremist opinions of that community. To add to that India is also completely unprepared to deal with propaganda and informational warfare in the internet age. We saw that in recent examples just on reddit where a rpak moderator was caught pretending to be a sikh khalistani and in the pulwama issue where even though every fact was in india's favour all the discussions in major subs were tilted pro pakistan. Its very easy to manipulate all online discourse in India with minimal effort even by a single individual. Doesn't even require some grand conspiracy by a foreign government.

I studied my 11th intermediate in Deeksha junior college and had a triple experience studying there, I wasn’t really sure of what to do in my life since I thought I could live with the natural flow. I joined a SSC college and realised that apart from JEE/NEET coaching there really wasn’t anything else. In Hyderabad, out of 10 colleges that I picked almost 10 of them were running with only JEE/NEET coaching. I was disheartened because all my dreams of becoming a lawyer that I have developed later in grade 11 have shattered. Our country or atleast our city is has Institutions running just to produce Engineers and Docters. The IPE education that’s the basic education I was receiving was also bloody terrible. Pardon my language. As suicidal thoughts emerged another institution called PAGE popped into my head they were offering a good amounts of various coaching s such as CLAT,SAT/TOEFL/GRE,BITSAT and many more courses I was overflown in happiness I th goth I could begin my progress for becoming a lawyer, but as I proceeded for admission in the month of March,at which point of time the results of my 11th IPE exams hadn’t come out yet, I was informed that if I don’t manage to clear all my subject I would have to discontinue in the institution. I was sure I wasn’t going to clear my MATH 1A thanks to the poor and inconsistent staff in my college. I’m a cent percent sure about passing in all the rest subjects but then what has put our education system down is that where in the next 5-6 years of my education in a law school while doing LLM or BscLLB will I be taught math. I agree that being knowledges about basic math is important but in my case I’m expecting at least 65/75 in my MATH 1B paper. But surprisingly my opportunity to join a course I wish is dragged away.

I have never in fact been to India, but my grandfather and great-grandfather were ethnic Indians who to some extent upheld The Raj. Needless to say that I am opposed to colonial ideals, but I have also been fascinated and to some extent shocked by the direction that India, as well as Pakistan and Bangladesh, have taken since partition.

Having been in contact with lots of Indians (and also Pakistanis) throughout my life, I would like to hear your opinion on the current state of the current, prevailing mindset in India (while I fully acknowledge that this is  broad and to some extent impossible to define).

For example:

1. Is the authoritarian (talk-down attitude) something exclusive to Anglo-Indians (or rather the older generation of Indians/Pakistanis living in The UK)? Or more widespread?
2. To what extent is the Caste System still an important part of people's lives?
3. Is paleness/fair-skin still something that is ardently sought after?
4. What is the cricket chat like (in person)? Having seen India play a few times at The Oval I have to say that the support is impressive and jovial, but online the trolls suck! Is the discourse in India closer to the former or latter?
5. Any other insights you have about the impact of the colonial mindset on modern India?

1549026999.0,2,53,47,"Hello, I'm a 24 year old Swedish woman who met my Indian boyfriend who was doing an exchange program at my university in Lund Sweden. We've been together for almost a year but his student Visa is ending so he must return to his home town of Gwalior in India. As I've recently completed my education, he's asked me if I'd like to join him back to India and live with him for a few months while he saves up money. At first I really liked the idea, I really to visit India for the first time as well as meet his family. However, I recently came across a few articles that described Gwalior as India's most dangerous city for women.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also this video of a Half Swedish, half Indian made India sound terribly dangerous. She said people can get chopped up there:  [https://youtu.be/OafSeEqFaw0?t=140](https://youtu.be/OafSeEqFaw0?t=140) 

&amp;#x200B;

I also heard that it is even more dangerous for Western women than it is for locals. My boyfriend assures me that things will be fine for me there, but he grew up in a family with only brothers so he might not know how it is like for women. Furthermore, I enjoy wondering around on my own and from what I read, that won't be possible for me in Gwalior as I'm a woman.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'd really like some feedback from people here. Would it be safe for me to spend some months in Gwalior as a independent Swedish woman who likes to explore alone, or is that too dangerous?

1548049986.0,2,17,22,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",t5_2qh1q,"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/

1547726276.0,2,59,328,"I returned from a long trip on January 14 and finally hit the bed after traveling whole night on 14th noon. I was suddenly wakened up by my sister who informed me our maid's son consumed poison.

I was shocked and still unable to grasp this happened. On top of that maid's family at her home was being uncooperative by telling her he consumed and then telling her he didn't consume poison. The kid's elder sister didn't seem to care much if he dies and was rather taking the situation very lightly.

I got furious and immediately took maid to her house where we found her son - a young chap hardly 13/14 year old. He couldn't walk, was injured ( with some plasters - at least a week old) and was crying with pain. Some kind of foam was also coming out of his mouth.

Turns out his sister thought it would be a good idea to take his brother to a 'Bengali' doctor. I appreciate the doctor who refused to take this case and asked her to go to district hospital instead.

She had no idea how to call an ambulance and was searching for a rickshaw when I and our maid arrived there in their colony. I immediately took the kid in my car and his mother to the district hospital where he was given first aid and referred to another bigger hospital.

I arranged the ambulance ( called 108 - had to explain the situation and the doctor on duty at district ambulance had to validate my claim). It was like a series of 3-4 conference calls, which was handled very very professional. In 10 minutes tops ambulance arrived and we took the kid to the bigger hospital.

The kid consumed some insecticide which had a main component - dichlorvos. I got the kid's sister to Whatsapp me the image of the insecticide and then was letting doctors know what he had exactly consumed. This helped them quickly take action. 

On hearing what the kid had and after seeing his situation - doctors told me his survival chances are low and I was asked to get his mother to sign a form for treatment with her acknowledging the risk of death, which I feel is pretty standard.

Sometime later his brother joined in the hospital, he was getting adequate treatment by then. Three days later, the bottom line is kind got discharged from the hospital and is doing well. I didn't expect government infrastructure to be so great, I'll definitely be more honest in doing my taxes. Cheers!

&gt; Meera Sanyal, 57, had joined the Aam Aadmi Party after quitting her job as the country chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, and contested a Lok Sabha election in 2014

&gt; She was a noted figure in the economic circles was awarded as Philanthropist of the Year by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry (FICCI) in 2011. 

&gt; As an AAP activist, Sanyal was instrumental in the petition that challenged Mumbai Port Trust’s handling of coal imports in Mumbai’s Haji Bunder port area. She pointed out that the area spread across 25 acres was facing environmental and health threats due to negligence on the part of MbPT.

&gt; Sanyal also authored a book entitled ‘The Big Reverse: How Demonetization Knocked India Out’. 

&gt; She reportedly left various Whatsapp groups of AAP members last month, saying she wanted a ‘detox’ from social media.

&gt; Vice Admiral (retd), president of APLI Mumbai, a non-governmental organisation, hailed Sanyal’s ability to bring together people from diverse walks of life with the objective of formulating public policies. “She had charisma to attract the young talent, old people and others to formulate the public policies,” said Rao.

**Venue**: Zayed Sports City Stadium, Abu Dhabi, Capacity: 50,000

**Time**: 9:30 PM IST

**Opponent** : United Arab Emirates are not only the hosts, but also a strong team. At FIFA ranking of 79, they are reasonably higher than us on the ladder and will have the home advantage as well. In the first game, playing against lower ranked Bahrain, they only managed a 1-1 draw with a dubious penalty. Blue Tigers will feel they can challenge the hosts for a good game.

**Where to watch?** : The game will be available on Star Sports, Jio, Hotstar. The users not in India can join us at /r/IndianFootball on match thread. We may have some more information about other options for the streaming on the day.

**Lineups**: Indian coach Stephen Constantine made a surprise selection of starting young prospect Ashique Kuruniyan ahead of experienced, but out of form striker, Jeje Lalpekhlua. The strategy paid dividends as Kuruniyan earned the penalty for Indian team and was a stand-out player of the game. India will probably start with the same line up against UAE as well.

*Starting XI* : Gurpreet Singh, Anas Edathodika, Sandesh Jhingan, Subashish Bose, Pritam Kotal, Pronay Halder, Anirudh Thapa, Halicharan Narzary, Udanta Singh, Sunil Chhetri, Ashique Kuruniyan.

*Subs*: Narayan Das, Amrinder Singh, Balwant Singh, Jackichand Singh, Vinit Rai, Sumeet Passi, Salam Singh, Vishal Kaith, Sarthak Golui.

**Tactics** : If you want to know about India's playing style, [this post by /u/curtainh8r](https://greyareaanalytics.com/blog/afc-asia-cup-2019-thailand-vs-india-tactical-analysis) should give you a good idea.

Captain that wins more matches: Kohli; Followed by Dhoni and Ganguly (No surprises here but not so fair).

Captain that gave the biggest boost to Indian team: Ganguly; Followed by Kapil Dev and then Kohli.

If you take a 30,000-foot-view (sorry for consulting cliche), Ganguly, Kapil Dev and Kohli did lead Indian crickets' transition in their respective eras. They improved by quite a bit from what was handed over to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Winner of the Best Indian Captain (so far): Ganguly;

Why: Transformational leadership\*\*.\*\* Gave biggest boost to the Indian team. Admittedly, Ganguly part of that boost because Tendulkar didn't do the best of job as a captain and faced tons of politics for team selection. Although, I am positively sure Ganguly faced them too and was able to get his way off-field. Ganguly got an attitude change in Indian cricket that was never seen before. Add to that, Dravid who followed Ganguly didn't do better than what Ganguly left him. Dhoni, our ODI world cup winning captain, greatest finisher of the game - should have gotten a much larger boost from when he took over the reigns from Dravid or Ganguly Win%. About him not winning WC -  ODI world cup is just one tournament that happens every 4 years and just one format of the game, entire captaincy career cannot be judged based on that.

&amp;#x200B;

Agree or Disagree - why?

1553501692.0,7,79,2006,"In one of the best sports performances in Indian history, Indian team of 284 athletes have clinched 368 medals at the prestigious Special Olympics World Summer Games held at Abu Dhabi between Mar 14 to 21.

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs &amp; abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men &amp; women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I've seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)

These are the smiles that deserved extensive coverage in the media. They deserved interviews. Their stories deserved to be told. They have the potential to inspire and change lives. But, alas, hardly did we even realize that such an incredible feat was even accomplished in India.

#[](#icon-notes-big) Introduction

Returning to the AFC Asian Cup for only the 4th time ever, India will be looking to improve on their performance back in the 2011 edition of the competition. Back then, India were paired in a group consisting of favorites Australia and South Korea while Bahrain, a regular decent Asian side, also featured. India lost all three matches, with all three pretty much decided by halftime, but the fact that India participated was what mattered. This was India's first Asian Cup appearance in 27 years, since 1984.

***1964 and 1984***

India first participated in the AFC Asian Cup in 1964, the competitions 3rd edition. India qualified automatically after all other teams in the Western Zone of qualification withdrew. Despite that, India showed why they deserved to be in the competition by finishing as the tournament runners-up. They started with a 2-1 victory over South Korea, followed by 2-0 defeat by hosts Israel, and finally a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong. This would be India's best finish in the tournament.

India would fail to qualify for the Asian Cup until 1984, when they finished 2nd in Group 3 during qualification. However, unlike 20 years earlier, India couldn't make it out of the group stage and ended last in Group B (consisting of China, Iran, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore).

***Path to 2019***

India's path to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup began in 2015 with the qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Despite being in a group consisting of Iran, Oman, Turkmenistan, and Guam, India finished in last place, with only 1 victory and 7 defeats. This meant that India didn't qualify for the World Cup and the Asian Cup automatically but instead had to go through another two rounds of qualification for the Asian Cup.

India were drawn to play against Laos in the play-in round for Asian Cup qualification. Following a 1-0 victory in Leg 1, India managed to destroy their opposition in the second leg 6-1 (7-1 aggregate). India now had one more round of qualification to go through. They were placed in Group A consisting of Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, and Macau. India managed to comfortably qualify after winning 4 of their matches, drawing once as well.

#[](#icon-info-big) Players to Watch

[**Gurpreet Singh Sandhu**](http://blog.cpdfootball.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/20150228-gurpreet-singh-sandhu-1.jpg): The 26-year-old goalkeeper has 26 caps for India. A product of East Bengal, Sandhu moved to play in Europe in 2013 when he joined Norweigan side Staebek. He was the club's 2nd choice goalkeeper but played in the Europa League qualifiers with them before returning to India and joining Bengaluru. He played a massive part in Bengaluru finishing 1st in ISL last season and did well in the ISL Final. He is tall (6 ft, 4 inches), can stretch really well for saves,. and commands his defense well. Weakness is probably his agility but he makes up for it by making himself big in major moments.

[**Sandesh Jhingan**](https://www.sportsindiashow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sandesh-jhingan.jpg): 25-year-old centerback with Kerala Blasters. Came out of nowhere after okay performances in the I-League. Joined the Blasters in 2014 and has now become captain. 6 foot 2 inches, he is a good reader of plays, isnt afraid to get stuck in and tackle, and good at heading the ball away or in on corners for India. Weakness can be that he tends to be rash and is a walking yellow card.

[**Sunil Chhetri**](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201806/12_0_0.png?kU1RHdHlAjNbmryKAa9_dp1l6XcHieBL): India's main man and arguably best player EVER. 34 years old but despite that, has 65 goals in 103 games, a lot of them coming in the last 4 years! Has played abroad in the United States and Portugal, he is India's posterboy and still does well in the Indian Super League for Bengaluru. This season he has 5 goals in 11 matches. Physically very strong but agile as well. Technical ability is great and his finishing is out of this world

[**Jeje Lalpekhlua**](https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fiaa.jpg): Expected to be India's starting striker, the 27-year-old Mizo has done well since making his debut in 2011. Has 22 goals in 52 matches. Whether he will do well here is questioned right now as he isn't in the best form. This season for Chennaiyin in the Indian Super League, Lalpekhlua has not scored a single goal from 11 matches. Last season he managed 9 goals from 20 matches.

[**Udanta Singh**](https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/06/udanta-759.jpg): The 22-year-old speedster is one of India's best young talents. Great dribbling skills, decent passer of the ball, and good off the ball, Udanta will be one to look out for at the Asian Cup. Will be relied upon for the counter. Weakness is his finishing.

**Notable Mention**: Rowllin Borges and Anas Edathodika

#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion

- **The Coach: Stephen Constantine**: India's coach for the Asian Cup is Stephen Constantine. The Englishman will be coaching a side in the competition for the first time. He is credited with helping India improve drastically in the FIFA rankings. When he arrived, India were ranked 173. India is now 97. However, it can also be noted that he was India's coach during their horrendous World Cup qualification campaign, overseeing bad results such as a defeat to Guam. The players have also been reportedly vocal over their dislike of the coach, including Sunil Chhetri. Despite this, Constantine has helped India become a more cohesive unit and more organized than they were under the Dutchman, Wim Koevermans. He has also given opportunities to young players but has also be criticized for not selected all the best players and having favorites, many of which don't play for their club sides. Tactically, Constantine prefers either a 4-2-3-1 or 4-4-2. He has been noted of using route 1 football.

- **Our Predictions**

 - /u/EnglishHooligan
: Expected India to lose all 3 matches but hopefully not as badly as 2011. United Arab Emirates are tournament hosts and will be looking at this match as the match to go all out, at least in the first half. Thailand and Bahrain will also look for 3 points against us as the strategy will be whoever doesn't get 3 points against India would be knocked-out. Honestly, not upset if we lose all 3 games. Losing them would mean our coach would be sacked. Still won't be rooting for defeat.

 - /u/konoha_ka_ladka
: We are the weakest team in the group no doubt. So expecting us to finish last. But luck has been on our side recently and good sides haven't been able to finish inspite of creating plenty of chances against us, case in point 0-0 draw with China. Hence a hoping for a positive result vs Thailand or Bahrain.

 - /u/nishitd

1547451595.0,7,17,69,"After a win against Thailand and a loss against UAE, Blue Tigers are ready to take on Bahrain on 14th January in the final game of the group stage.

**Venue**: Sharjah Stadium, Sharjah, Capacity: 11,000

**Time**: 9:30 PM IST

**Opponent** : Bahrain started strongly as they managed to hold the hosts and group favourite UAE to 1-1. However, against all odds, in the next game they lost 0-1 to Thailand and now have found themselves at the bottom of the group with just 1 point. They'll be desperate to win all 3 points to qualify for the next round.  

**Where to watch?** : The game will be available on Star Sports, Jio, Hotstar. The users not in India can join us at /r/IndianFootball on match thread. We may have some more information about other options for the streaming on the day.

**Lineups**: Indian coach Stephen Constantine has started the same XI against both UAE and Thailand. We can probably expect the same against Bahrain as well. 

*Starting XI* : Gurpreet Singh, Anas Edathodika, Sandesh Jhingan, Subashish Bose, Pritam Kotal, Pronay Halder, Anirudh Thapa, Halicharan Narzary, Udanta Singh, Sunil Chhetri, Ashique Kuruniyan.

*Subs*: Narayan Das, Amrinder Singh, Balwant Singh, Jackichand Singh, Vinit Rai, Sumeet Passi, Salam Singh, Vishal Kaith, Sarthak Golui.

**Bottom-line** : As this is the final game of the group stage, the games will be played simultaneously. We won't know what exactly is needed for us to qualify. However, these are the three scenarios:

1. India wins - We'll qualify as either the group leader or 2nd in the group.

2. India draws - We'll go through to the knock-outs as one of the top ranked team among 3rd placed teams, or possibly even runner-up in the group. 

3. India loses - We still have chance to go through to the knock-outs, provided **Thailand lose against UAE** and the complex math in other group works out in our favour.

It's just a young bloke speaking his mind on an already controversial subject. Social justice has been whipped up to inhuman standards recently.

We have cricket officials and public figures trying to scuttle a talented cricketers career over something utterly insignificant.

Meanwhile, Salmon Khan can continue acting despite having driven over and killed people with his car while drunk.


*what Pandya said -*

""Why don't you ask women's names at nightclubs?"" asked Johar when Hardik replied saying he struggles in remembering names of the women he interacts with during such parties. ""I like to watch and observe how they move. I'm little from the Black side so I need to see how they move,"" Pandya responded.

He dwelled onto his sex life suggesting, ""When I lost my virginity, I came home and said, Main karke aaya hai aaj (I did it today)”. Further highlighting the casual take on the subject from his parents, the 25-year-old revealed how ""cool"" he is with his family members. 

At a party my parents asked me acha tera wala (women) kaun sa hai (Which are your women)? I said yeh, yeh, yeh (pointing out women) and they were like waah proud of you beta,"" Pandya asserted.

Another question from Karan Johar that attracted a debatable response from the two cricketers was, ""If you all hit on the same women, then how do you decide?"". Rahul answered saying, ""up to the woman"" while an outspoken Hardik said: ""Nahi nahi aisa kuch nahi hai, talent pe hota hai. Jisko mila woh leke jao (Nothing like that, it's about talent, whoever gets them, takes them)""

I have seen many companies do it. They put out vacant positions on their websites but eventually they just onboard a hiring consultancy that will provide them often technically sub-standard resources at dirt cheap price. They hardly even evaluate the candidate to check her/his capability.

Most resources hired via consultancies are often not very strong technically and have a hard time performing in a business setting.  They are also a burden to the existing full time employees because most of their time is spent on providing knowledge transfer (KT) to these new joiners who don't even take ownership of the projects. They don't even care. Heck, most are not even accountable. Some of them just stay for a short stint, enjoy the perks and abandon the projects mid way blaming work life balance and lack of KT. And then the entire process of hiring and KT keeps repeating for ever.

What is the logic behind this? Why do companies do this? Do the HR departments of companies have some sort of shady deal with these consultancies? Is the HR department so overworked that they have to deal with consultancies for hiring? Or are these vacant positions on the job boards just a formality that the companies have to do to show themselves as an active hirer?",t5_2qh1q,Why do companies put out vacancies on their websites/job boards when all they do eventually is hire contractors from consultancies for those positions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ak9em5/why_do_companies_put_out_vacancies_on_their/

1553477632.0,1,34,140,"'m going to come right out and say I'm not Indian so there are no misconceptions. I lived in India (Hyderabad) for about six months, and I loved the time I spent there. The garbage was one of the most distressing things about my time in Hyderabad. Not even the university I was attending had a proper garbage disposal system: it was all piled up and burned.

I didn't want to sound preachy so at first i said nothing, but eventually the litter started to get to me. When my Indian friends would throw garbage on the ground I'd say ""Pick that up."" Usually they'd laugh, and about half the time say something like ""Why? It's not my job!"" They would usually stop laughing when I stooped down, picked up the trash and put it in my pocket.

But this made me think harder about the problem. Even if I put it in a bin, it just gets piled up and burned. Is that really better? The question changed from ""How could someone do this to their own country?"" to ""How can we put the breaks on this trainwreck?"" There was no waste disposal system, no recycling center or landfill, no proper incinerator and no organized trash collection service. So in reality, even if the trash got cleaned up and put in a bin, what would happen to it then?

I started thinking about my home country as well. We wouldn't have public places being covered in refuse, there would be public outcry. But what do we do with our garbage? We stick it in a hole in the ground and hope it doesn't decompose. Doesn't really sound like a solution, does it?

The problem is bigger than the specific cultural attitudes one country holds about cleanliness in public spaces. We need to totally reassess how we live our lives as modern humans in relation to our biosphere. We need to cut the amount of plastic we all use down to probably a third or less of what it presently is, and find way to reuse and recycle all of that. We need to kill the idea of ""disposable goods."" We need a common, human sense of responsibility to and for Nature.

Obviously, the cultural attitudes about garbage and environmental stewardship on the subcontinent need some work, and people need to take pride in the natural beauty India has to offer, but the larger societal forces at play (fed in large part by consumerism) need to be addressed on a global level as well. If everybody works together, we can give our children a better world than our parents gave us, but it's probably going to be painful. I believe, and this is just a belief, but I believe that if we act locally and think globally, adhere to an internationally recognized doctrine of ""care for each other means care for the Earth,"" and focus our gaze steadfastly on the future, we can only do good.

Anyway, sorry for the rant.

Have been trying to reach Ola but it’s just not possible. The support section gives a number that just says use the number provided in the apps support section. That’s exactly what I am doing (screenshot attached). There is no direct number to reach them. I did find some numbers online but either the automated system greets me and call get disconnected automatically or someone actually picks up and hangs up within 2 seconds. 

Well what if this was more serious, like a medical emergency or something. To try this, I selected a different reason, ‘safety’ in support section. There was a direct number but that too was getting hung up automatically. And it’s not my phone issue I tried another phone. 

Seriously shitty experience.

1552752924.0,1,41,91,"This is about the parental addiction to IIT coaching for their children. This has been happening for quite a long time. Indian parents are pushing their children to get coaching in IIT from a young age. The earliest I've heard was one of my 11th class batchmates telling me that he had been undergoing entrance exam coaching since 8th std. You might know even more extreme cases. An overwhelming majority of these students are forced by their parents and their childhood gets sacrificed.  These students don't get a chance to experience the growing up stage properly and to be well rounded individuals. They are often set up to get depressed in their adult life because they would be working on something they are not at all interested in, or worse they don't have any jobs.

So like the alcohol ban, PUBG ban etc, we need a IIT coaching ban in India since IIT coaching is misused by parents. Once the ban is in place, people running underground IIT coaching centers and parents who send their children there should be arrested by police and then let go with a warning. Repeated offenders should get significant jail time. Any student should feel free to report their parents , if they are pressurized to study for IIT. We can start with the coaching ban in Rajastan. Lots and lots of depressed souls in Kota can finally get relief.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Parents pressurizing and harassing their children and enrolling them at coaching centers against their will is a serious concern. I have seen several instances of this in my life. I am sure many of you would have seen this too. The child protection laws in India is a joke. One of the reasons, I posted this is because we have become a ban trigger happy society having the mentality of banning things we don't like and depriving people who enjoy these things. I understand that there could be some students who enjoy going to the coaching centers. They deserve to be able to go to these coaching centers. The recent events where people were arrested for playing PUBG is ridiculous. I know banning is not the way to go for any of the above cases. But a majority of people are happy or not concerned about these bans because it doesn't concern them. What ban will it take for people to finally wake up?

I'd prefer good point conversion ratio over anything else as it gives me the freedom to spend over anything I want. Trying googling but most sites are full of paid reviews of cards I know for a fact are not that good. I spend 20-25k per month on my cc (all expenses except rent). Reviews of cards I've used so far:

1) HDFC regalia first: 4 points (=1 re) on 150 rs. Hassle free services and no fake transactions or anything plus free lounge access (visa). Plus flat discount on Amazon sales

2) SBI irctc: good point conversion ratio and service charge on tickets are waived off but points are pretty useless since you can only use them for 2nd tier ac tickets and I haven't been able to link my loyalty account thanks to the shitty support service

3) HSBC: got sold by the 1+1 movie ticket offer only to realize later that the discount is limited to rs 200 plus they login system is the worst I've ever seen

4) citi platinum: good points but not many offers on shopping/dining compared to hdfc cards

I have the HDFC infinia on offer but that's too costly for my needs (10k annual fee waived off only after 8 lakh worth of spends). How about amex gold, hdfc diners card? (I don't fly that often so not looking for miles cards)

1551143866.0,1,61,180,"This was 5 years back when my life just turned upside down when I lost a family member and it affected all spheres of my life in way I had never imagined. I gained weight and hated each second at the job. My OCD and anxiety overtook me and I literally realized what is internal conflict and overflow of emotions.

It was like every little thing was going haywire, I was not earning well. I wanted to build my portfolio but then did not know what to do. When your family is it self crumbling with emotional issues the only thing you can do is deal with it alone and that is not the best feeling in the world. I finally quit my job, a big MNC where I was destined for better pay but because of the onset I was spending up to 12 hours on the job and lagging behind because of no interest. I quit and finally took my life in my hands. I sat at home for an year, rolled myself into a course which took me 2 hours each day to go and visit. Came back home, studied and lived a physically comfortable life. I taught myself the things I wanted to always and changed my industry that way. I was never a CS guy going by my educational background. But I now I am working in IT.

That 1+ year helped my knowledge, I used to sit up nights coding and learning and listening to music. I learned slowly but I did. I finished that certification and got a job in around 1.5 years later since quitting my last job. This job was paying me no where close to what another guy in the same industry would get, just because I had no relevant experience. I took the offer just to gain experience. In the meantime my physical and mental well being started showing major signs of deterioration. I had gained a significant amount of weight, because of good home food and lots of stress.

&amp;#x200B;

Then during the latter half of 2017 my life completely changed for good. One day I got up and after being depressed and locked in my room for 4 nights, I told myself that enough is enough. I started one thing that changed my life completely. I started working out.

Cut to right now, one thing led to another and now I am outside India working and earning better. I had never lived alone my entire life and here I am learning and exploring more about myself more than this new country and its culture. Dealing with different people and **being more grateful for a life I wanted to end at one point of time**.

&amp;#x200B;

My 2 cents:

1. Thinking positive is very important, **what you think you become**.
2. Working out is not about gaining abs, working out helps you mentally more than physically specially if you are going through mental issues. When you work out, your mind is occupied and relaxes while your body works out. **I lost 17 kgs in 3 months. I not only got fitter but disappointed a lot of people who never believed in me.**
3. Music helps a lot. I cannot say how much music has been a help for me. As I have changed, so has my taste but **a good tune can reveal and make you learn so many things about yourself.**
4. **Share your problems**: I finally had the balls that week in 2017 to speak to it to one of my family members. They had no clue it was anything this bad. They knew I was an introvert but this made them understand me better. And I got even more support. Believe me when I say that your family is your best friend. They will always be by your side when the world is against you or even when you are. Friends are rare, keep them close specially the good ones.
5. **Pour your thoughts by art**: Write, sing, speak or even discuss. It helps. But do not do it on Facebook. That place is for drama and judgement. Reddit is the best for this I suppose. But I would recommend doing this in real life.
6. Believe.
7. Savor the small things in life before they are gone. When you see someone smile when you are depressed, it does help a little. **Since I lost someone and saw him burn infront of my own eyes I have made sure I make my close ones know how much I value them.**
8. And finally, **TRAVEL ! EAT ! and keep yourself BUSY**! Being busy is an art.

Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

1548219553.0,1,47,63,"*This is a rant from the customer side of the app. Drivers might also be having problems with Uber but that's not the point of this rant.*

First, the stated arrival time before we book is almost always wrong. The app shows something like '2 minutes away' and right after you book it climbs up to 5 sometimes even 10 minutes.

Second, the drivers fucking don't move unless you call them up. And the conversation always goes 'Kahan jana hai, sir?' (What's the destination, sir?) Bhosadike, if you signed up on a platform, at least have the decency to offer service by their rules. And, since this seems to be such a common issue, why doesn't Uber simply disclose the destination before they accept the trip.

Third, there are drivers who say they are coming, make you wait for 7-10 minutes and then cancel. Is this some kind of revenge for riders who cancel when drivers are moving towards them? Or, is it because there's some kind of penalty for drivers cancelling trips? Do they do this in hope that customers will cancel? Bhosadike, just tell me to cancel when I call you.

Fourth, pool riders who have no consideration or empathy whatsoever for other pool riders. There should be a special place in hell for people who book a pool ride sitting on the 69th floor in a corner building of their 420 acre corporate campus with no cab entry. Then, they usually look for last mile connectivity in to the middle of buttfuck nowhere with no roads. And son, why on earth would you book a pool ride if you're already running late for you flight or train?

Finally, their feedback system is absolutely useless. The option to choose 'bad co-passenger behaviour' is simply absent for pool rides now. In general, all feedback beyond the five stars is just categorical. There's no scope to write qualitative feedback even after we select 'other'. Considering Uber's capabilities in machine learning, one would assume they'd like to apply some kind of insight recognition algorithm on all the qualitative feedback they'd get.

At this point of time, the only reason to stick with Uber is because they are marginally better than Ola.

So I went out and bought a jar of parachute coconut oil. Since then I've been using it frequently. 

I use it in stir frying vegetables and gives a lovely coconut smell to the food. highly recommend it. 

I also used it instead of butter when baking cake and it also was very nice. The hint of coconut was a great addition.

But my fav was to add a tea spoon of it to my tea. Yes, it does float to it top, as oil is wont to do, but I worked around that by drinking it out of my personal thermos which allows me to shake it well before drinking. It mixes just fine, and it makes me feel a new energy in the mornings that I havent really felt before.

1549736452.0,1,39,20,"Okay, a little info about me, I am 24 years old working class male living in a metro city. So, around six years back I had issues with depression was under medication and all, but I stopped going to my Psychiatrist and joined a engineering college thinking I am alright and things will eventually turn out fine. 

Time passed on, I even made some friends but that part about me which craved a connection was never satisfied, I always felt like an oddity, someone who cannot relate to anyone, someone whom people don't want around, I even let people use me by helping them too much, by letting them make fun of me, and then college finished and I got a job, but I was never mentally satisfied in my life since I was diagnosed with depression. 

It's like depression broke my entire mental state, It made me believe in the meaninglessness of everything, made me lazy, destroyed my fears of things that can completely destroy my life, made me an social outcast and I have never been able to grow out of that personality. 

I think no one really knows me, no one in my family knows me except for maybe one person, no friends, no one. I became bad at connecting with people and sort of started accepting my loneliness but nowadays it gets really tough sometimes because of family issues, life in general and I feel like I have made no progress in my life ever, I have just wasted it away. 

You see, that feeling that you are worthless, but I am trying to change my lifestyle, my attitude towards life, towards myself and be a better version of myself. 

Now you can say why am I writing all this stuff up here, the reason is because I need some sort of support in my life, I am completely broken from inside tbh, and it will take some time and some support to grow again. I just needed to put some things out, because I cannot talk about this to anyone in my life. Not to my family, not to anyone of my friends, I am a lonely fuck.

Every time you say you doubt what someone (who did not learn English in India) says you express distrust. Be very careful when doing so towards a superior etc.. ""Doubt"" is typically not applicable when in a situation where you learn something from someone else who has more knowledge about that specific topic.",t5_2qh1q,Dear India: 'doubt' doesn't mean what you think it means.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aq52fm/dear_india_doubt_doesnt_mean_what_you_think_it/

1548491473.0,1,7,15,"Ok. Perhaps I am dumb but this is what the news reports led me to believe: you get up to 100 free channels for a network capacity fee of Rs.130. Whatever pay channels you add, you have to pay extra. This is not the whole truth!

You have to pay a network fee for ALL channels you choose (free and pay), not just the first 100 free ones. So suppose you choose 100 free channels and 23 pay channels. Suppose the 23 pay channels cost an extra Rs.50. So you would think your total would be Rs.130 + 50 (I am omitting GST for sake of simplicity). No, it will be more, because your TOTAL channel count has exceeded 100. So you have to pay Rs.130 for the first 100 channels, Rs.50 for the pay channels AND the network fee for the additional 23 channels (Rs.20).

Network fee for additional channels (over the basic 100 channels) is Rs.20 per blocks of 25 channels. Network fee applies for both free and pay channels.

The kicker is that HD channels count as two channels each for calculating the total number of channels for calculating the network capacity fee.

Another example: you have 10 free channels and 20 pay channels (all HD) which cost Rs.100. In this case, total number of channels is 10 + 20 x 2 = 50. Since this is less than 100, the network fee will be Rs.130. You will pay a total of Rs.130 + 100 = Rs. 230 (again, GST omitted).",t5_2qh1q,TIL the TRAI basic Rs.130 fee for 100 channels is not what it seems.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ajz871/til_the_trai_basic_rs130_fee_for_100_channels_is/

He was the first Indian PoW during the conflict.

**PS:** The air force operation called ""***Operation Safed Sagar***"" was one of the key factors in recapturing Kargil from Pakistan and the subsequent victory for India. 

It should also be noted that no plane was allowed to cross the LoC which led to serious issues for the IAF and even the pilots had to rely on weaker navigation systems as the US did not allow use of their advanced GPS [which lead to the development of the indigenous NAVIC satellite navigation system] to keep track of the border.

1551675688.0,1,93,126,"As a consumer, I've tried all these options and discovered that D-Mart offers the most reasonable pricing for most products used in Indian households.

Forget their brick and mortar competition like Big Bazaar and More, I've found their rates to be lower than even Amazon and Flipkart! (whom I believed until now to have the best pricing in town). For example, I recently looked up a Preethi gas stove on Flipkart and its price was about ₹5600 whereas the same product was available at my nearest D-Mart for only  ₹5200!

From my observation, I think D-Mart offers better pricing due to following reasons:

1. They purchase in bulk quantities, so economies of scale compared to local kirana stores and smaller shops.

In countries with a right hand traffic system (like The United States), you should walk on the left side of the road.

This gene makes bacteria resistant to regular strong antibiotics and it kills half the patients who develop a blood infection.

The antibiotic - Colistin (Doctors call it the “last hope” antibiotic) is used to treat patients who are critically ill with such infections resistant to nearly all other meds.

In India at least five animal pharma companies openly advertise products containing ""Colistin"" as ""growth promoters"". Their continued use in farming increases the chance bacteria will develop resistance to Colistin, leaving it useless when treating patients.

One of these companies is also a major poultry producer. Apart from selling animal medicines and creating its own chicken meals, it also supplies meat directly and indirectly to major fast food chains in India.

So got a craving for meat? At the very least pick mutton over chicken ... and avoid eggs, if you like living.

I try to spend my free time with her reading magazines, and other miscellaneous stuff, thanks to cyberknife treatment, she is lucid at the moment and can walk around for a bit 

My dad is planning to quit working (In the country we previously lived in), and move to India and take care of my mom. He's 58, and says that he doesn't have interest in working anymore and that we would also be financially secure if his 2 bosses give him the compensation money when he quits. However, this would mean that me, my mom and dad will lose our international health insurance, for which now is a shitty time. He also recently got influenced by a relative who introduced him to a naturopathic doctor who will give him some herbal med for my mom to eat which apparently won't affect her ongoing meds, which I'm not really okay with but I support him on it anyway. When I tell him about how losing health insurance would be a risk and what is he going to plan, he just told me ""well that's life"" but apparently I'm supposed to magically not let this affect me and seriously prepare for boards/jee, in my middle school days too, my mom had stroke twice, for which I used to remain seriously prepared with all her files and would also comfortably transport her to the hospital in an extremely efficient way while also controlling my panic.

1551619086.0,4,5,4,"Like many other Indians, I was using Spotify with the help of a VPN before it was launched in our country. I had signed up for it on a throwaway email account 4 years ago, and just last month I deleted the account for reasons listed below:
- I was afraid there won't be a way to change my Country on the account (previously I had tried changing from US to UK but there was no option to do so)
- I wanted to switch it to my personal email account
- I wanted to start afresh because my Recommendations were all fucked

When Spotify got released a few days ago, I immediately registered using my personal email and was ready to buy Premium as well. After signing up I noticed my username was not what I entered while registering but a combination of letters and numbers. Today, I browsed through the Help section on their website and found [this policy](https://imgur.com/gallery/oUX0HRC)

The thing is unlike the DNS level block implemented by other operators, Jio is using deep packet introspection which is very surprising to be used for a telecom operator. Funny part is when the server overloads, the DPI fails and reddit and pornhub magically starts to work.

1549115482.0,4,11,7,"I recently logged in to the amazon app using my friend's phone but something came up and in a hurry I forgot to log out of it. I told him over phone to log out of the app when I got home. He said he would but I am not sure if he did. Which is why I changed the password on my laptop through chrome browser. I wanted to double check so when I saw my amazon app in my phone, the app was still logged in.

So it seems like if you change passwords, you cannot log out of the app automatically. It just prompts you to put passwords again only if you log back out. But it threw me out on my PC where it was supposed to be kept signed in through Firefox app.

I am not sure what a person is supposed to do if their phone gets stolen? How in the holy world is this app supposed to protect our privacy?Fortunately there are no linked cards or anything on my account. And the only details it has are my email-id and few old addresses with my phone number. That friend is not so close to me so I cannot just go back to him to ask for his phone just because I have doubts. I think everyone should be aware of this.  


UPDATE - It took the app more than 40 minutes to throw me out after the password was changed. For those 40 minutes I had complete access to a fully functional account. I have uninstalled the app after finding this out.

1553319657.0,4,0,6,"Hi, 

Currently I am pursuing PhD in information technology. However, my work is progressing toward neuroscience (which I found as my energy converging point). Currently, I am studying emotions. Due to IT background, I am pretty well with the coding skills and applying it for customised high end GPU based calculations on voxel wise activity given some task. Although, I always have this feeling of lack of sufficient knowledge in the field of neuroscience. Although, I am trying my best to learn as much as possible but missing a disciplinary thinking while facing a complex puzzle. Although, I find myself studying about the neuroscience stuff without any sense of exhaustion, a leap step is needed to get deeply indulged in this exciting and important domain.

As it is a transition period for me where I need to use my relatively more developed computational skills to get the sense and pleasure of getting new in-depth knowledge of the field of brain science. I am seeking for the suitable guideline which can give me a better chance to grab the domain knowledge during this transition and lead me towards disciplinary thinking over more complex problems. I am interested in further studying emotions and related disorders. The guidelines during the PhD and after the PhD both are very much needed and highly appreciated. The guidelines can include anything from intern, clinical service, research associate to any junior level fellowship. I just want to learn more about the field.",t5_2qh1q,IT-to-Neuroscience?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4fjxb/ittoneuroscience/

I see many threads related to IT and CS engineers and it feels kinda lonely here on [r/India](https://www.reddit.com/r/India)...

So, come on fellow mechanical engineers, roll up your sleeves and tell us something on the lines of below topics...

1. Studying or working? Where( only if you want to) , what field and what do you do at work?
2. Why did you pick mechanical engineering( honest answers please!) and what do you like about your job?
3. What do you think about the state of mechanical engineering education and engineers in India?
4. Coolest project you've worked on or dream about working on...

I hope there are enough of us here to make this an interesting thread....!",t5_2qh1q,A shout out to all the mechanical engineers of r/India...,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b5kxek/a_shout_out_to_all_the_mechanical_engineers_of/

I am using Linux over 2 decades. Started with Red Hat Linux 5.x/6. The initial switch at a very early stage was the primary motivation. Luckily I could make a career out of it and hardware so I still have the luxury to contribute.

* The Range is okay not great not too awesome. 
* One Plus 6 shows me the battery status, the 6T would too but not sure about other devices.
* Pairing with other devices is super easy.
* No NFC
* Battery life is 5-6 hours never more than this.
* the audio is sync with video (or plain and simple No Lags)
* Charging is indeed fast 30-40 minutes for a full charge
* Call Quality is good, microphone is good
* I sweat a lot and so far the type C port seems to be holding up fine
* Audio Quality is frankly a bit overhyped. Wired Sennheiser ear phones that cost less than 2k will beat these on any day, again I don't know how other offering are at this range but people saying you got more than what you paid for seems like a crap claim. I have used the Samsung LevelU on a few occasions and the Audio Quality if you're using any device apart from One Plus or devices with aptX then the audio is not really that different, bullets wireless sounds better but again not like mind-blowingly better. Samsung LevelU has the ""hey seems like you're far away from the phone"" complaint  but so far people have not given me that complaint during my calls with bullet wireless.
* A few ear tips/buds provided spend time seeing which one is best. The default one gave a weird sound when the fan was running at full speed(I know weird). Audio Quality changed quit a lot with ear bud change.
* Some lag in PUBG not a huge dealy but still you can tell the difference with wired and these.

The reason I am writing this review is because many people want to buy wireless but I think you should really consider what your priorities are...

If Music Quality Gaming experience matter than sticking to good old wired is the best decision.

or may be go for something like the Sennheiser BT 4.40 which costs more but also has AUX Cable option that might come in handy when your gaming and every micro second counts :P

&amp;#x200B;

I know phone manufacturers are going all fuck headed about this but the choice of good wireless earphones is really slim.

A few cities have experience stores, always give the Sony/Sennheiser/Samsung etc wireless ear phone you are going to buy a trial. 

Buying purely based on reviews may not be such a good decision.

1550849070.0,4,19,6,"Needed to buy an Ink-Tank printer. And was pretty much sure about buying an Epson. But they have very limited online support. They don't sell ink online. Amazon has a few of them but mostly 3rd party ones. Same with flipkart 

Then saw HP ink tank printers . They have good online support and online store (with COD) for original inks. Specs wise they are same as epson ones. 

Price-wise, printer and ink costs are almost same. 3rd party inks are cheap af.

Had some questions - - 

If anyone has ink tank printers, can you recommend one? Also saw reviews about epson acting weird after some months (like resetting problem). Is it true?

Using 3rd party inks is safe? I'm not worried about quality as I will be mostly using it to print texts. 


Thank you :)

1553769745.0,4,0,2,"This post contains links to resources that you should look at.

#### Instructions

- **DO NOT** watch videos of youtubers talking about Tor. It is highly
likely that they themselves don't know anything about it and are just
reading a blog post written by some idiot on the internet.

- I am linking some videos, websites and you should watch/read them. If
you think there are better resources then comment below, I'll add them.
(link good resources and not someone just reading few blog posts and
talking about it)

#### Quick Q/A

Q: Is Tor illegal?

A: Not in India.

--

Q: Will it harm my computer?

A: Highly unlikely, it is idiot proof (not 100%).

--

Q: I've heard of people's webcams turning on, is that true?

A: Highly unlikely. Probably they were just lying for monies and it is
possible then they can do the same when you visit websites on normal
web.

--

Q: Can I watch porn through Tor?

A: Yes you can but I'd suggest get some free vpn -&gt; watch porn -&gt; delete
it.

--

Q: I don't want to visit bad (nsfl) websites, what should I do?

A: Nothing, just don't go here and there looking for links. 

--

Q: I am not going to donate anything to Tor Project, should I still use
it?

A: Yes, by using Tor you are helping the Tor Project. 

--

Q: What should I route through Tor?

A: Normal text based websites traffic, like reddit's (if you don't
consume too much media). You can ask your application to proxy its
traffic through Tor (if it supports).

--

Q: What should I not route through Tor?

A: There is no such restriction but you should keep in mind that all
those servers are run voluntarily and you should not abuse it. Maybe
don't route heavy files through Tor.

--

Q: Why do you write Tor and not TOR?

A: It's Tor and not TOR.

If you don't know about [Dissent Doe](https://twitter.com/PogoWasRight) you ought to follow her right away. She's 
been [voicing](https://www.databreaches.net/) security, and privacy concerns for a while now. 

Sometime last year, a security researcher contacted her about **Schoolcountry**'s website leaking 
thousands of students' personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, right down to grades.

She wrote to SchoolCountry on August 5, then again on August 10, without any tangible response. 
Or, action. She tried again on December 30, only to get back an autoresponse, and reported the whole
ordeal.[¹][a] 

We had been in touch with her around December, working on another breach[²][b], when she
asked us to help out. So, we did. This is how it went.

Saturday, Jan 12, 2019| Gunjan Agarwal | Seeing that Google still has **all** the data in its cache, we sent out a message again. |

# Epilogue

Afte the server was taken down, Dissent wrote about it, and raised a few pertinent
questions[³][c]:
 ""But how many IP addresses accessed those files while they were exposed? 
  The data would be valuable for spamming or phishing parents of students or 
  social engineering.""
  
If you are reading this ask SchoolCountry to fix it **NOW**. If you need reasons --
there are **7000** of them.

I am a computer science student currently pursuing B. Tech. Today I got to know about the ongoing sale on Durgasoft online courses. 

I was interested in purchasing several courses from there but they end up exceeding my budget. As it is the last day of the sale, I desperately want to buy them.

Is there anyone here who would want to share these courses along with me? We can buy them together if it is possible.

The course material I am interested in are : 

1. Python by Durga sir.

2. Spring Core by Ramesh Sir.

3. Spring Advanced by Ramesh Sir.

3. Hibernate by Ramesh Sir.

4. and Web Services by Ramesh Sir.


Is there any other way I can get these courses for less value. Right now they are available at 50% off with an effective price of INR 4720 each.

Are there any other online courses better than Durgasoft? 

Please help me out here. Any sort of advice regarding this would be appreciated. ",t5_2qh1q,Looking for a partner to buy Durgasoft online course.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b42za6/looking_for_a_partner_to_buy_durgasoft_online/

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.
2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.
4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.
5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.
6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival.
9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.
10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.
11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.
19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.
23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.
28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Michael O'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# Shaheed Uddham Singh

1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940
2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.
4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940
5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).

# Following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’  
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’  
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’  
>  
>""You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""  
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""  
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

&#x200B;

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",,"Did Sharad Pawar, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena just defeat BJP in the Greatest Game of Political Chess to have been played in India?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1yy9u/did_sharad_pawar_ncp_congress_and_shiv_sena_just/

I was watching a news report on Australia's bushfires the other day and witnessed the PM of Australia visiting an affected place and people there were ignoring his handshakes and were firmly asking him to release more funds to their place and by the time he was leaving, people were fuming and words like 'idiot' & 'f**ktwit' started flying around and he left. This is just an instance from another democratic nation for the analogy.Let's come back to India.Not saying in any way that we should be shooting swear words at the prime minister of the nation when he fails but being stifled to even raise a voice of dissent is not a characteristic of a healthy society. Modi has created this brand inside people's minds that he is some sort of occult infallible problem solver even when at times solutions are not asked for and are generally not the solutions for the realistic problems that persist.For he is not treated as a human being anymore,He has shaped into an emblem. An emblem of Hindutva. An emblem that is too venerated to be mocked or to take dissent. You disagree with them,You are an anti-national termite who should be sent to an adversary country. Supporting cow vigilantes behind the screen while displaying that symbolic solemn image to the public. Last time people revered a political leader and blindly followed him,a catastrophic world war happened.

Here's some background information: 

  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 

2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 

3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   


  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   


  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? I really love the girl, and do genuinely want to marry her, but the difference in cultures is a roadblock, and it is so frustrating sometimes.

1573174127.0,0,18,20,"Putting together a summary of what's happened and happening in Maharashtra. 

Prolouge

~BJP was very confident of a victory which will take BJP and allys beyond 220 in the 288 strong assembly confident of the work they did in these five years. Having the distinction of Mr. Fadnavis being the only CM to complete a full 5 year term in the history of Maharashtra

~BJP's pitch was that they flawlessly executed farm loan waiver worth 36K crores, multiple (26) big infrastructure projects, reservation to Maratha (similar to Kshatriya) community.

~BJP and Shiv Sena decided to fight on equal seats to avoid breaking up of similar vote base.

~The opposition's pitch (NCP + INC & oth) was miserable condition of the farmers, rampant law and order problems and facist nature of BJP

The results

BJP - 105   SS - 56   NCP - 54   INC - 44  MNS - 1  Others - 19 (Ind, AIMIM, CPI & Others)

~ 2 Cabinet ministers are not given ticket by BJP
~ 6 cabinet ministers lose election
~ BJP president's own district Kolhapur is BJP mukt
~ Majority of the people who switched parties are rejected by voters
~ Mumbai's mayor loses election
~ Thakrey family member (Aditya) becomes first from the family to contest or to be elected 


Who Forms the Government?

~Immidiately after results, Shiv Sena head Uddhav Thakrey says 50% partnership including CM seat for 2.5 years was promised and should be given

~BJP offers (sources/ news{ unconfirmed}) Dy. CM post and Finance and Revenue Department. But Shiv sena wants CM position and Home department as well as Urban Development Department.

~ SS party MP Sanjay Raut talks of being in touch with ""other parties"", BJP does not respond

~Talks of SS forming a government with support of INC and NCP on a high. NCP and INC (officially) deny, SS says there will be a SS CM for 5 years. BJP leader says we may head to President's rule if no party can stake claim

~ BJP Maintains that they will form a government only with Shiv sena. Shiv sena stays firm on CM post demand. Mr. Sharad Pawar says NCP is mandated to be in the opposition.


Today

As of today, no one has claimed to have majority and to form government, though all parties are having meetings at all levels. BJP leaders meet the governor but donot stake claim to form the government.

What next?

If no one stakes claim

Scenario 1

~The governor may ask the present government to continue for a few weeks till new government is formed. This is called a CARETAKER Government. If no one stakes claim, the governor may refer for President's rule. President's rule lasts only for 6 months and has to be ratified every 6 months. President's rule cannot last more than a year except Election Commission reporting to centre it's inability to conduct elections.

Scenario 2

~ BJP accepts SS proposal and forms government with 2.5 years of CM seat sharing, first 2.5 of which are SS. It is yet unconfirmed who will be the CM face from SS and what portfolio (if) is given to Aditya Thakrey

Scenario 3 

~ NCP supports BJP unconditionally (It did last time)

Scenario 4

~ NCP + INC support SS unconditionally and SS CM for 5 years


Edit : 
~Shri Vasantrao Naik has the distinction of being the first CM of completing a full 5 year term

Edit 2: 
~The governor may ask for the present government to continue to deal with Agri Crisis in the state due to unseasonal rains.

~The results of elections rectified as per ECI website.

It was well known he was a hard left individual, with interests in the Russian revolution's Marxist and Socialist policies. He was a patriot and nationalist but never thrived off of it. In my view, it was the best kind of *positive* nationalism wherein you respected and fought for your nation's freedom and dignity but also participated in the active growth of its people from a moral and economical standpoint and did not rely on relentless fanning of the flames to attain unity.

Imagine an India which was built on strong but fair leftist grounds which stressed on equality of sexes, equality of opportunity, **mandatory education**, economic liberation, powerful military and more with equal stress on India being Democratic Republic. 

> Subhash Chandra Bose never interpreted nationalism in its narrow ,perverted and aggressive form. He viewed Indian nationalism from the stand point of  a humanist To3 Bose ,‘Indian nationalism is neither narrow, nor selfish, nor aggressive.It is inspired by the highest ideals of the human race.


There is unequivocally nothing that can really beat this combination of non-exploitative, non-authoritarian socialist country. I know some think-tanks have flirted with the idea of Bose being a ""Hitler"" but one, he was pro-Democracy and two:


> “When I first visited Germany in 1933, I had hopes that the new German nation, which has risen to a new consciousness of its national strength and self-respect, would instinctively feel a deep sympathy for other nations struggling in the same direction.Today,I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish, but also arrogant”

In my opinion, India should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for **mass education**, equal opportunities, equality of sexes, liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty AND THEN gone on to open up the market internationally and engage in (controlled) Capitalistic ventures where you invest in foreign countries and foreign countries can invest in yours, independent businesses can thrive and so on and which will see a surge in not only economic status but exchange of culture with the people of India **ready for such a venture** as opposed to now where most Indians barely know who they are, what their history is and what their culture is about.",,[Politics] How would India have looked like if it was Subash Chandra Bose who took over as first Prime Minister?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ewi9qq/politics_how_would_india_have_looked_like_if_it/

There are offices where senior managers harass / shout at juniors, there are colleges where senior students rag juniors, there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so on.

In many of the cases, I have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors. Many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. Do you see the problem here? - This cycle is never going to stop. One able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.

So here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. When you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids).

1577463335.0,0,2,22,"We're unaware of this but internet has more influence on shaping a human being's personality than anything else. All our opinions, All of our data, All of our knowledge in one place being accessed by simply typing into a search engine. Just a decade back we were being conditioned by our immediate social circles, The concept of nuclear families is universally accepted because it's very effective, It's the classic rule of one Jedi master for one padawan.  A 2-parent household is more likely to have a higher consistency to raise their children by reaching an agreement on discipline and modelling appropriate behaviour as opposed to a community at large. But today Internet has clearly filled the gaps in between.

Internet has become so powerful that it is shaping world history as we speak. Who would've thought an encyclopaedia of all human knowledge would actually make us dumber. This brings us to the most important topic  I want to talk about, Politics. There have been many governments toppled over before, many fascist regimes brought to the ground before the internet was just a bunch of Orkut testimonials. But now we have a tool, A tool to organise, educate, mobilise and agitate on a larger scale but unfortunately this tool doesn't come with an instruction manual. The state knows how to use this against us because well it is powerful and has the resources to form detailed strategies. It was comparatively easier to open a political debate and convince someone before the Internet than it is now. Since the state can control and change what you see, they get to control narrative and their supporters always lap it up.

I've worked a corporate job for 7 years now and what I learnt from managing my team is singling out a person doesn't help anyone's cause. The only way to get someone on your side is to address the issue at large. It helps you and the person on the other side of table be more objective. The voice of dissent should be a voice of reason not a voice of hate. Otherwise we just get perceived as online Lynch mobs. 

I  just saw a lot of people making memes on the expensive sunglasses worn by our PM and am guilty myself of participating in it too. Then I realised whatever helps them deflect from the narrative is our defeat. Any distraction from the real cause is counter productive. Any hate directed towards the person instead of their work is very easy to convert into oh they just hate him. That gives the state a lot of space to promote fake achievements and window dressed figures.

Any sort of dissent which directs abuse at a single person especially a fascist makes them stronger. 

""Chowkidhar chor hain"" turned into ""Main bhi chowkidhar"" and changed the narrative big time for the LS elections. The ability of narcissists to victimise themselves is unparalleled and their blind supporters will lap it up, It beats our purpose. 

What fascists hate the most is when you show them they’re wrong. Don’t address the person, address the issue. Criticise the polices, the bad governance, criticise their work.  I know this sounds preachy and I’m sorry but this approach has helped me big time while opening discussions with loyal RW people and convincing them.",,OPINION: How to be objective with political arguments in the era of internet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eg8im7/opinion_how_to_be_objective_with_political/

Few months back, he has instructed party top brass to keep Hindu-Muslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming years.
But Shah is Shah, his entire political career is based on communal politics, and he is quite dope on that and cannot survive if he doesn't do his regular drama.

Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. A party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. A finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. I hope the BJP, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a PR firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like Congress, TMC, CPIM, AAP which have quite a bit of expertise by Indian political standards. I hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

And folks speaking about the strong leadership of Marendra Nodi - The over centralisation of his government has resulted in one very incapable man doing a lot of stupid things hurting a lot of people.

Some people abused Rahul Bajaj for criticizing the scare-tactics of government. Now, I see the same behavior in bullying of Zoho owner and Accenture Chennai exec for agreeing to participate in an RSS event. This, in my opinion, is not different from several incidents where speakers from different side of political spectrum have been stopped from giving speeches in universities and other places.

Why is it so difficult for us to accept that there are other people with views differing to ours? Is there a need to personally go after every person who is against you and create an atmosphere where people are afraid of expressing their opinions? I found the criticism of Virat Kohli most amusing because of his refusal to give his views. Forget about opposing our stance, even not supporting our stance is supposedly a crime.

I am a liberal on most social issues in India (including CAA + NRC). But, I can live with certain celebrities or corporate executives supporting the government without boycotting their products and movies. I don't want a country where people are afraid of expressing their views in public. Certainly, the Modi fanatics were the first to start this atmosphere of fear on political topics (on topics like religion, this has always existed). I don't want to contribute to it.

Now to proceed, I am going to rant about the recent experiences I've had with cops, medical professionals and some common folk.

Starting with cops,
My dad is a cancer patient and has to 2 chemos every month. 
When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital, daily, obviously. 

After the lockdown, at the fuel stations, they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who wasn't a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes (i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions) which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolice.in. Which is why 1 day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me, and asked for the bar code provided for registration. I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it's not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency, to which the cop hit me with his batton, used language like, ""would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine wasn't home"". Like this is the example he thought of coming up, and for a fact I wasn't strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else's bike.
These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible.

Now about the medical institutions, specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL. 
Last month when my dad was admitted, the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs. Like literally the entire ward, was filled with bed bugs, to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month.
This month after the COVID-19 situation got worse and lockdown was announced, they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital, despite of the situation going around, and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app. 1k for a day only for stay.
After the above experience, this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse.
Now, on the second and third day they didn't change his bedsheets. He was left in the same dirty sheets for 3 days, and he is cancer patient, we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins. They didn't provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets, while they have entire wards empty. 
His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection.
And for this when we tried to voice out, the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us, as if it's us who is making the mistake.
And to top this off, they charge the entire bill, not a penny less. We are spending like fucking 7.5k for a day (minimum) , we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit.

After the above experiences, I am in a dilemma, like what is it to be someone in power, what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand. Like seriously, is being a plain human that difficult?
These officials may it be a medical or political, do they really have power over us. 
Truth be told, they are whatever they are, because we make them.

TLDR : The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell.
Btw I know doctors who are practicing in Australia and stay in constant contact with us to ensure my dad's healthy, yet I am shocked the ones we came across who are getting paid from this are acting this way.",,"Is it only the common people who have to abide by the rules, boundaries and whatever......",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4n0hx/is_it_only_the_common_people_who_have_to_abide_by/

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

Millions of frustrated math students in schools across India have complained a million times about how nobody is ever going to use pythagorean theorems in real life.

1474989754.0,6,24,13,"This will be a long post, apologies in advance. I've been a lurker here for quite a while. Figured this is the best place to get a few pointers. I took up running a couple of years back, my weight peaking at around 89 kgs. Today I weigh around 70 kgs. I didn't change my diet while doing this. Still ate the same amount, still drank the same amount. Just made sure I ran for 4kms five days a week. Before I put on all the weight I was quite skinny. Now that I'm going that way again a lot of people have been saying I've become way too thin and look emaciated. I don't really agree with them because I feel great. My stamina has improved and I've started playing sports again. And I definitely don't look emaciated. But it does bother me enough to contemplate stopping running altogether. I decided to start working out to compliment the running. Figured some muscle would help. I have noticed a slight difference since joining the gym (slight muscle gain and more fat loss)

 Here's the problem. A lot of people in the gym are these beefed up replicas of Hercules or Achilles, okay not that good but you get the point. Really bulky muscular guys. I don't really want that.  I want some advice on how to get lean muscle. Types of workout routines. What I should eat. What I shouldn't. I'm really bad at sticking to a diet but my meals are usually a healthy mix of veg/non veg. But if something helps i will definitely give it a shot. Is there anything i should really avoid apart from the usual junk food?

This is the first time I've joined the gym and I've been relying solely on YouTube to learn different exercises. So any advice would be really really appreciated.

1471603522.0,6,26,28,"The real problem with sports in India is nobody plays any. It's not about the government, not about celebrities, or media. It's the people who have failed the nation. 

We think that the government does not invest in a social infrastructure to develop sports and the media does not pay attention to it. While that is true and these organisations can do better, that's not the whole truth.

India has so many problems that need attention, that sports often comes off as a luxury, would you allocate money to feed the millions who are starving or make sure every college has an asphalt track. It's easy for the government to turn a blind eye toward this.

News media, covers sports all the time, they just don't have anything to say. All newspapers have a sports section, people literally read only the sports section, that's why those pages are in colour. 

**Now, what's the real problem?**

The problem is PEOPLE don't care about sports, we only do, once every four sporting years, during Olympics or world cups, when we lament about our dismal performance. This is our national time pass, we are not really concerned about improving the state of affairs, we just love to complain. 

This is the real issue. None of us play any game or sport. Look at the people in your friends circles, none of them play any sport professionally, they are just pursuing a hobby or they only played at school or college, probably making it to the state, district level, before being talked out of it, to join the rest of us in pursuit of jobs that all of us hate.

And the people who do play, at national level, mostly do it to secure cushy govt jobs or admissions via sports quota. Clearly, there's a lack of serious contenders. Because it is hard. You can be sub-par at academics, and still land a good job. That doesn't extend to sports. If you are not the best, you cannot put food on the table, and the prospects of growth is limited, once a sportsperson is out of form or suffers an injury, he/she is finished. The window of opportunity to make money or obtain fame is narrow. 

###Sports does not pay.

The solution is to make sports 1)cool and 2)lucrative. Cricket is popular because people think its cool, and those who are smitten by it and who pursue it, don't drop out because of how big you can make if you do. 

The solution is to participate, if you are good play, if you're not follow. Make noise. Buy tickets to lesser loved sporting events.

1562121722.0,6,7,11,"
One word has become synonymous with the current economy and job market, that's automation. Automation has been happening all around us for years, but the pace of it has increased substantially in recent times. We are staring at highly automated work environments where the need for people has become inefficient, automation has crept up slowly across industries and has become a major threat to future economies of countries. The problem is, that there hasn't been a concrete solution, no one seems to be agreeing on what could be the solution to this. 


Automation, in manufacturing industry has been constantly increasing, the coveted assembly line model by Henry Ford that streamlined the manufacturing process by making it efficient has in these modern times been a reason for automation to take over jobs. A decade or two ago you could see people working in assembly line, but now if you go to any manufacturing plant there is a high chance that you'll be seeing people only doing quality inspection on the assembly lines instead of doing any assembly, that's because all of it is being done by Robots that have gotten so efficient and cost effective in the long run that there is no reason to have people assembling it. 


Look at the IT sector for an example a decade ago when you dialled a customer support of a company there would be people picking up your phone and addressing you concern or complaints but now when you call customer support of a company, it's a jumbled mess of pre recorded options that you press, if you are lucky and have pressed the right options for a couple of times you might get lucky and actually have a person who might address your problem. Now think about both of these examples, the expertise required for assembling has been replaced by inspection of assembled stuff, which requires much less technical knowledge and experience. Same goes for the IT sector, now a couple of hundred of people can handle a country's customer support because of pre recorded options. This has obviously helped in increasing productivity in both industries and has made it easier and efficient process.


There have been people who have dismissed the buzz words of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning), but software tools powered by AI and ML have been able to make a dent in management industry as well. For some time automation has only affected the workers or the labour intensive tasks, but AI powered software has made many management position redundant. In the service industry, you can already see bigger retailers, either going online or having less and less number of people employed in their stores, with the high penetration of internet, now payments have become increasingly cashless and you can see stores with self checkout counters in the west. You shouldnt be surprised if in the future you enter a mall early morning to get your groceries and you end up being the only person in the whole mall, since every task now has been automated. 


The major industry that is yet to be affected by this onslaught of automation has been driving, the goods carriers, the taxi drivers and truck drivers, the delivery guy who delivers your Amazon orders or the Swiggy guy who delivers you your food. There is a big chance that over the decade you might see all of them disappear, with self driving cars and trucks, drone delivery for goods becoming a reality, the industry will move quickly and make all of these automated. Atleast, now you can take that extra nap you need in your self driving car when you head out to work or eat your breakfast in it. 


Imagining all of this, must give people a sense of comfort, on how the future will be becoming more convenient, but the fact is that it would come at cost of hundreds of thousands of jobs. While, it is true that newer jobs will be created, there is no doubt that it will never be as many as automation will be replacing. There have been solutions to these suggested such as robot tax which is taxing a company more for more automation, or solutions such as Universal Basic Income which addresses the post automation world where jobs are less and people need to be subsidised for living. While not working does seem like an absurd option, maybe it actually isn't, hobbies can become lifestyle choices, more people can go into sports, with the space exploration in the horizon maybe we can go back to exploration, while this will obviously guarantee that capitalism will make the balance of society uneven where we will have the ultra rich that will have majority of the wealth distributed among a single percent of the population, it will be the job of the future governments, economists and leaders to address these problems.

Note: I made a post about content writing and got a bit of PMs regarding samples, so I just made a Reddit post about it. I'd appreciate your advice and suggestions.

# Corona virus - What it is?

Novel - First time human immunity system is being exposed to this virus

Corona virus - Family of viruses with crown shape

**Symptoms**

Please **monitor your temperature if you have dry cough**. If you get high temperature & any of the mentioned symptoms in point 2, please seek medical advise. In a case, if you have sore throat , please practice social distancing and isolate yourself.

The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and  beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the  incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly  around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become  available.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are

1. **fever, tiredness, and dry  cough** (The AND is important point to note\*\*)\*\*.
2. Some patients may have **aches and pains**, **nasal congestion**, **runny  nose**, **sore throat** or **diarrhea (Apart from mentioned above)**.
3. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
4. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
5. **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease  without needing special treatment**.
6. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
7. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop  serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing  should seek medical attention.

**Spreading**

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose  or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other  people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if  they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

**Asymptomatic Spreading**

&#x200B;

1. If a person is asymptomatic, it is highly that he is not communicating the disease till he follows a good personal hygiene.

The main way the disease spreads is **through respiratory droplets**  expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with  COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the  early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19  from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel  ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of  COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings. 

# How to protect yourself

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

&#x200B;

1. **WASH your hands** : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
2. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from  their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you  can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person  coughing has the disease.
3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?  Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,  hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,  the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
4. Make sure  you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This  means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when  you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?  Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you  protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and  COVID-19.
5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever,  cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in  advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why?  National and local authorities will have the most up to date information  on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.  This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other  infections.
6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19  hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading  widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are  an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
7. Self - isolation period should be 5-14 days.[Guidelines for Home Quarantine](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Guidelinesforhomequarantine.pdf)
8. Please call ahead if you are visiting a doctor.

**Please make sure if you use mask , you know how to handle it. Incorrect handling and using of mask will lead you in troubles (touching front of the mask, not disposing it , touching mask again and again to adjust it)**

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially  coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable  face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after  someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide  shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)).

The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are  to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow  or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from  people who are coughing or sneezing. See  [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information.

Guidelines for home qurantine

## Recommendations for travelers

It is prudent  for travelers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas,  in particular for elderly travelers and people with chronic diseases or  underlying health conditions.

General recommendations for  personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one  meter from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for  all travelers. These include:

* Perform hand hygiene  frequently, particularly after contact with respiratory secretions. Hand  hygiene includes either cleaning hands with soap and water or with an  alcohol-based hand rub. Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred if hands  are not visibly soiled; wash hands with soap and water when they are  visibly soiled;
* Cover your nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or  paper tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing immediately of the  tissue and performing hand hygiene;
* Refrain from touching mouth and nose;
* A  medical mask is not required if exhibiting no symptoms, as there is no  evidence that wearing a mask – of any type – protects non-sick persons.  However, in some cultures, masks may be commonly worn. If masks are to  be worn, it is critical to follow best practices on how to wear, remove  and dispose of them and on hand hygiene after removal (see [Advice on the use of masks](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1269003/retrieve))

As for any travel, travelers are also advised to follow proper food hygiene practices, including [the five keys for food safety](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/en/5keys_en.pdf?ua=1&ua=1), as well as [recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to human in live markets](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

1494883276.0,6,133,106,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",,We really need to talk about Flairs.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/
1503513788.0,6,3,43,"tl;dr—I'm not Indian, but I have lived in India before (small town in Kerala, 4 years) and am planning to stay in Pune for at least a few months later this year. I will only be working part-time online, so I would like to spend a good deal of my free time ""getting in shape."" When I look for information or subscription services related to healthy meals targeted toward audiences in India, the majority seems to be Western food. I prefer veg Indian food, though. What are your suggestions?

EDIT: Advice along [these lines](http://www.azadsinghfitness.com/blog/punjabi-food-for-fitness/) would be awesome!

More about me: I'm a guy from the US. In January, I left the US with the goals of escaping Trump and saving money, and because I prefer living in Asia (I lived in Japan for a year as a teenager, Kerala in my late 20s, and currently staying in Vietnam—love it here).

I was adopted from Korea, so basically, I'm a white guy in an East Asian body, and also a body that seems to maintain the same weight whether I cook vegan food for myself in the US or eat out for every meal here in Vietnam. (1.76m, 60kg, ""skinny-fat"")

I have always found it difficult to stick to exercise regimens as I have never been athletic or one to enjoy sports. However, this year, I discovered I enjoy cycling quite a bit and my city bike is currently my cardio machine and transportation here in Vietnam. I am considering getting into kettlebell exercises, so then my next thought was how to optimize my diet.

During my previous stay in India, I was living on a veg campus (not a college campus, but I don't really want to discuss it in detail) and all meals were prepared by the staff. I am not vegetarian, but when it comes to Indian food, I prefer veg over non-veg (and North Indian over South Indian, except dry upma). The only thing is that a vegetarian Indian diet is essentially all carbs and maybe a few grams of protein.

I would prefer to find a meal subscription service or a hire a cook if I can. But when I Google about this, I either find lists of ingredients (useless because I am not just going to eat boiled chana and raw almonds all day), or Western-style meal plans / recipes (why would I want to eat oatmeal in India? and oatmeal is disgusting anyway). Any suggestions on how to adapt ""real Indian food"" for this purpose?

This section is dedicated to those who couldn’t make it. Those who tried, but failed. Those who raised, but burned. Those who stood, but had to sit.

* No news so far about a startup closing doors. A good news maybe.

1443013888.0,6,469,150,"Final top level edit : I think a lot of people are turned off by what they perceive as ""material comforts"" when all I'm talking about is life experience. Roti, kapda, makaan - at the heart of it all it's something we all need. Please don't tell me these aren't the aspirations of Indians in India. The overarching point of this post is to highlight that I'm not special, these are the positives an ordinary middle class coder can find. And without even talking about the outliers like the Nadellas and Pichais, Indians here in the US are far more successful than this and do great things, give back a lot here and back home. Of course this is my perspective, who else could I speak for? :)

Thanks for all the comments, the PMs and insightful thoughts.

____________________________________________

Greetings!

At least once a month I see threads on /r/India where people complain how miserable they are in the states, and how much things suck here. While I don't think this is utopia, I find that people seem to overwhelmingly dwell on the negatives to make some justification about life in India. As someone who spent about 20 years in India and about 10 in the states I feel I have an alternate viewpoint to offer. 

I got here after leading a sheltered life and had to scramble fast to figure life out on my own. In doing so I feel like I got to a position where I could choose what I wanted out of my life. So yes, I'm rather happy here and I can see why this is still the #1 immigration destination in the world (recent events in Europe notwithstanding). 

Lets set some baselines here. If you're reading this, you're at least part of the ""middle class"" with some basic education and no worries for food or housing. So if and when you do come here you'll fit into the educated middle class easily enough, if not better since the Indians that come here are quite well educated. 

Is there poverty on the streets? Sure. Does the medical system need major reform? Of course. Will any of it really affect you? Not really. Will you understand any of this if you're here for a 3 month contractor gig or a 2 week visit to your cousin's place in New Jersey? Hardly.

For most immigrants, life revolves around employment. It generates income, visa sponsorship and health insurance. Until you get your greencard, it's all or nothing. You have a job? You're probably well educated with at least a bachelor's degree and a desirable skillset. This will set you far ahead of a lot of natural born Americans and you will simply not face any of the problems they do. 

You will easily be able to rent if not own your own home in your late 20s to early 30s, live in a good suburb with at least a decent school system. If you're good with your money and investments you'll have the material comforts you want and more. 

Once you're above a paycheck to paycheck situation though, you'll realize that life is better in ways you couldn't possibly have imagined. Want to be a loner recluse and play DOTA all day? No one cares. Want to be the guy throwing BBQs all the time and having neighbors over? You can do that. Outside of downtown districts of the big cities, traffic is predictable and far more disciplined than anything you'll see in India. If you want to get swept up in the hustle and bustle of the big city, you have that option too.

Land is relatively cheap and in abundance, there are parks and trees everywhere. Gas is cheap. The entire world of media consumption is centered around the States. If you'd like you can see a band every day of the week. For free or for whatever you want to pay. I've had Kirk Hammett melt my face with a MOP solo right in front of me as I bounced in the mosh pit. I held Janelle Monae as she crowd surfed in Coachella. I high-fived Trent Reznor after his show. I've had some random band in a bar play Kashmir for his ""new Indian friends"". Pick your genre of music and the arts - you'll find a 100 other people like you. Food and craft brewing are unparalleled. 

edit: And I'm not even go into the convenience of netflix, amazon prime, newegg etc.

Depending on where you live (yes, this is big so don't use it to discard my entire premise), crime isn't a factor. I recently discovered that the tailgate on my car hadn't been locking in the last 2 years. In the mean time, I've parked it in several different cities, at least 3 states, several times in the airport and not one thing lost. I left the windows down a the bus station for an entire day and my ipod was lying in plainsight - nothing stolen. It's a great life when people aren't trying to con you 24/7.

Sit at a bar, order a shot for you and the two guys on either side of you - you'll make best friends in no time. If you have game, go talk to 2 chicks on the other side see if you get their phone number. It'll happen, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Watch a football/hockey/soccer game in a sports bar and high five random strangers as a your team scores. No one will you don't belong.

People complain about tipping, but do they tell you amazing the service industry here is? Do they tell you how any waiter will joke with you and genuinely be interested about your day? That if you complain customer rep for even a multi billion dollar bank will bend over backwards to please you?

These are not the things that people seem to talk about here. Will this be a uniform experience all over the states? Nope. I'm biased towards the white collared suburbs because that's where I fit in. But the fact is that you'll find your niche if you look and the life you want will be **far easier** to achieve here than anywhere else. 

**I've obviously focused on the positives here because that was the perspective I wanted to share. Of course there are negatives that people ~~circlejerk~~ talk about all day.** So if you are here, or are visiting - get out of your comfort zone. Don't hang out with 10 people from your city and cross road and spend all your time doing what they do. If you're in India, remember that you only see the stats worth reporting. If you feel offended that /r/worldnews focuses on rape in India tell yourself that you're not doing any better by basing your opinion of what's said on /r/politics or even reddit as a whole. 

TL;DR - India vs US - Who's to say what's better? I've made my choice, I ask that you don't decide until you see for yourself.


Edit: those that are telling me there are negatives, of course there are. I have said several times that this post is about the positives, and that they far outweigh the negatives. If you're unable to digest that without jumping in with anecdotes you're totally missing the point. Goodnight from me, have a nice day.

And thanks for the gold!",,"[R] Life in the US gets a bad rap around these parts, here's some perspective.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3m151q/r_life_in_the_us_gets_a_bad_rap_around_these/
1470674056.0,6,104,251,"I was a National level U17 Athlete. I came third in Triple Jump and qualified for High Jump for Nationals but couldn't participate because of ligament tear. 

I started off in 6th standard by competing in inter school competitions. I started off in TT and Handball. I couldn't get past district level in both the games. Even though I was good, even if not excellent in these respective sports. After trying to crack TT and Handball for two years, I got fed-up and turned my attention towards track and field event. Since that was the only place were they can't do politics at least to a certain extent. 

The problem starts here. 

1. Every PET is given a particular sport to select the best playing team at district level. The ideal thing to do is to select only the best players, but the reality is that Mr. A selects most of the players from his school or if another PET recommends his student to be selected. They do select good ones but for a team to perform well, everyone needs to be the best. The district level team will compete in State level with other teams, even if there is one exceptional player in any of the district team, he will not be selected for States because his team lost. We end up losing so many highly talented players due to this stupid selection. 

2. My PET was assigned to select Hockey, naturally most of the national level players from my school were from Hockey. This is how it is for many schools. 

3. The amount of politics is insane, so many hardworking, well deserved players are not even given a chance to show their talent. The PETs wants to push their students as much as possible. 

4. Most of PETs don't know anything. They have literally no idea how to train an athlete. There were 2 PETs in my school. One was old around 40 something and another one was a newly graduated PET. If it wasn't for the newly talented PET, I wouldn't have been in nationals. She brought in so many new ways of training, that helped me perform. According to my old PET, everyday I used keep jumping, that was it. Just jump, jump and jump. 

5. No proper training facility and diet to boost the athletes. Whatever funds that are allocated for food, doesn't even reach the athletes. I trained in a non-even ground, which may been the reason for my ligament injury. 

6. Discouragement from everyone. Teachers, parents, relatives and even friends. My first Nationals was in 10th Std, the amount of beginning I had to do to get relieved from my teachers was harrowing. Everyone wants an IIT kid and not an athlete. 

7. Sports medicine. Absolutely nil. They don't even know such things exist. 

For India to shine in Olympics, it will take decades of dedicated corrective measures, change of mentality, corruption, politics to be sorted out. 

I just saw a video in the morning where Indian women's team won the 4x400 meter relay, I guess it was the CW Delhi. Indian team clocked 3:27.52 and the world record is 3:15.17, that shows the quality of athletes. 

Edit: Just remembered that my grandma's neighbour was Surekha first Indian Female Pole Vaulter to cross 4 meters. I used to visit her house when I was a small kid, she is married to Renjith Maheshwary, the Triple Jumper who qualified for Olympics. He is not a medal hope, but if he betters his jump by 17.50, he would be at least in the top 5 and that would be something.! ",,Why we will never make it big in Olympics.

1437709097.0,6,33,54,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon.

1428014589.0,6,119,82,"Hey everyone I'm /u/doshiamit creating this post to let the community submit questions for Cyrus here. 

Cyrus has started a new podcast called Cyrus Says available at cyrussays.in, and we thought it would be interesting to see if we could try a reddit AMA with audio. 

Here is the podcast description: Hosted by the inimitable Cyrus Broacha, Cyrus Says is the definitive show on life in urban India, politics, sports, civic sense, traffic, kids, food, and everything that matters. Mostly.

So this is the plan: Please submit questions before 10am IST on Saturday(4/4/2015) morning. We will be recording at 11am on Saturday. We'll do as many questions as we can in an hour to 90 minutes. Once Cyrus is done, we'll start uploading the answers to soundcloud and than give a link to that answer here(protip: with RES installed you would get a player on reddit, no need to leave the site). We'll also upload the full podcast which will be the entire session, so you could listen to the individual answers if you want or the full podcast.

Here is a verification pic from Cyrus http://imgur.com/9M80aoy

EDIT: We are about to start the recording. Thanks for your questions everyone. We should have responses up by this evening.

I’ve done a lot of research about the nutrition problems affecting India and here is a list that summarizes all of them. Desi brahs, hope this helps you.

Diet problems:

1) Vegetarian diet
-a. Zinc deficiency
-b. Iron deficiency
-- i. Anemia
-- ii. Thyroid issues
-c. Vitamin B12 deficiency
-d. Vitamin D deficiency
-e. Vitamin A deficiency
-f. High phytate intake

2) Poorly balanced (even non vegetarian diet)
-a. High carbs (>60%)
-b. Low protein (<15% usually around 10% for pure veggies)
-c. Bad fat intake
-- i. Either high fat or low fat diet (depends on region) and most of this could be saturated fat or sometimes trans fat.
-- ii. Diet is typically very high in Omega-6 and VERY low in Omega-3 (much lower than the western average).
-- iii. In south india, ghee (mostly saturated fat) and vegetable oil (sunflower oil (high omega -6) or something worse like coconut oil/groundnut oil (high saturated fats)) are used.
-- iv. Most people haven’t even heard of flaxseed and most don’t eat fish (both good sources of Omega-3s).

3) Poor intake of food groups
-a. Dairy products
-- i. Typically only 250 ml of milk (high fat or 2%) every day
-- ii. Around 200 grams of yogurt every day, made from the same milk as above
-- iii. Cheese is not at all a part of Indian cuisine. We only have paneer (Indian cottage cheese) which is high in fat. And only north Indian cuisine uses paneer. South Indians usually don’t eat it.
-- iv. If eggetarian, egg intake is very low, like 1 egg a week or worse. Otherwise NO egg intake at all. Probably causes:
---a) Biotin deficiency
---b) Choline deficiency
--v. Calcium deficiency and Vitamin D deficiencies are very common
-b. Protein/fat sources
-- i. Abysmal nut intake (nuts eaten once a month or worse and only as part of a cooked dish or sometimes eaten as a snack(like peanuts))
-- ii. Mostly peanuts are eaten. Almonds are eaten a little less often. Other nuts are much more expensive and hence not eaten.
-- iii. Even though vegetable oils are used, due to them being labeled “fats”, people tend reduce their intake of these essential fats.
-- iv. As a result of the above two, Vitamin E intake is very low.
-- v. Even those eating non vegetarian food do so only once or twice a week.
-- vi. Non vegetarian food is seen as a delicacy.
-- vii. Fish (source of Omega-3s, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin B12, choline) or chicken is eaten but not with enough frequency to have much benefit.
-- viii. Red meat is usually avoided (good source of iron, zinc, vitamin B12 and protein).
-c. Fruits/Vegetables
-- i. Although many people are vegetarians, they don’t deserve to call themselves so. Fruit intake is pathetic. Most people do not eat any fruits at all, and those who feel the need to, eat only one or two types of fruits and only a single fruit a day if at all.
-- ii. Fruits like grapes, strawberries, blackcurrants, berries, dates etc. are expensive in comparison to the local fruits and hence are almost never eaten in most families.
-- iii. There isn’t a concept of desserts so fruit salads are unheard of in traditional cuisine
-- iv. There are many different types of vegetables available but most people tend to eat a restricted set of vegetables. Green leafy vegetables may not be eaten regularly. Magnesium deficiency may be possible (happened to me)

4) Poor quality carbohydrates
-a. Most of the carbs have very high glycemic indices
-b. North Indian diet has better quality carbohydrates if whole wheat is used for chapattis etc.
-c. Sometimes refined flour is used which lacks nutrients and fiber
-d. If bread is eaten, it is typically white.
-e. South Indian diet is particularly bad
-- i. Medium grain white rice is staple
-- ii. Tends to have low fiber
-- iii. Low satiety and hence people eat a LOT more than they should in order to feel full (firsthand experience)
-- iv. EVERY damned dish is mixed with rice. Even rasam (which is basically a soup like concoction) is poured on top of rice which has little effect on the carb to protein ratio as it is mostly water.
-- v. Rice is typically overcooked (as undercooked or correctly cooked rice is considered a sign of poverty). This raises the glycemic index to >90!
-- vi. Daily glycemic load is around 200! That’s twice the recommended value! And keep in mind this is for TRADITIONAL food as people have been eating for generations.
-- vii. Causes HUGE blood sugar spikes followed by sudden drops. Blood sugar destroys skin. Causes people to feel tired after meals and even throughout the day.
-- viii. Other dishes like breakfast and snacks are ALL basically made from pastes of rice and some dal. Example: Idli, dosa etc which have UNBELIEVABLY high glycemic indices like 95+. This dishes as with most others require almost no chewing.
-- ix. Higher prevalence of zinc deficiency than the north because of a combination of factors such as no beans (except green beans) or peas in the traditional cuisine (like kidney beans, chickpeas, lima beans etc), no nuts etc.

Lifestyle/Traditions:

1) Most people get no form of exercise
2) Academic study is given prime importance in schools resulting in decreased time and interest for sports
3) People do not even walk all that much
4) Low sunlight exposure because most people tend to avoid the sun.
5) Both my parents are highly Vitamin D deficient (6 ng/ml normal value >50). And so am I (15 ng/ml).
6) This is widespread.
7) People unwilling to accept that their diet and lifestyle is bad
8) As a result people tend to have low standards of what an “average” person should look like so anyone with excess fat or a ****ty physique is considered “normal”. Most people are super weak as well as fatty.

Effects:

1) Possible pregnancy complications or birth defects due to deficiencies in the mother (typically iron and zinc deficiency)
2) Poor development during early childhood possible (but this is more of a problem in poorer areas)
3) Delayed puberty or slow mainly due to zinc deficiency
4) Poor stamina due to widespread prevalence of anemia (More so in south india)
5) Severe deficiencies may result in stunted growth
6) Zinc + Vitamin D + essential fat deficiencies = POOR testosterone
7) High carb diet causes insulin resistance (pre-diabetes)
8) Many people have acanthosis nigricans like darkening of elbows, knees etc (indicative of insulin resistance)
9) Poor lipid profile (typically very low HDL (30 ish), high triglycerides)
10) Poor skin tone (oily/dry/acne/imperfections/dull)
11) Poor hair quality (Dry/frizzy/thin/brittle etc)
12) Because the body is bombarded by high glycemic foods, the resulting insulin spike could possibly cause a significant cortisol spike. Sugar->Insulin->Cortisol->Sugar->…
13) As a result abdominal (visceral) obesity is RAMPANT. The skinny fat look is almost SURE to occur in most people eating like this
14) Low lean muscle mass due to low protein and hormonal imbalances
15) All this fat storage and related hormone imbalances cause increased estradiol levels in men or testosterone levels in women. Mean tend to look effeminate (fat stored in all the “wrong” areas like butt, chest, face etc). Women may face increased body hair due to hirsutism (PCOS).
16) Zinc inhibits testosterone-> estradiol conversion as well as testosterone-> DHT conversion. DHT is mainly related to libido and excess levels could cause hair loss and balding as well as extreme horniness which doesn’t help the low zinc situation.
17) India has the highest number of diabetes patients in the world.
18) Heart diseases are common.
19) Poor nutrition causes low IQ but this mostly affects the poorer classes.
20) Worst of all, people have been eating like this for ages and this results in poor quality offspring (low birth weight, skinny fat baby syndrome etc) and these traits get passed on to each successive generation.
21) Hypothyroidism is common (related to low iron), results in edema, facial puffiness, eyelid puffiness, hair loss etc.

Solutions:

1) DO NOT EAT TRADITIONAL INDIAN FOOD
2) DO NOT EAT TRADITIONAL INDIAN FOOD
3) Get your blood tested to check for Vitamin D, Calcium, Thyroid hormones, Zinc, Copper, Testosterone, Estradiol, Vitamin B12 and maybe others you may want.
4) Take a quality multivitamin to fill up any possible nutritional gaps
5) Eat a balanced diet (DUH!)
6) If any deficiencies are found, fix them. ZMA usually helps most Indian dudes.
7) Use a quality protein powder (whey/casein/protein mix etc)
8) Creatine also helps
9) Once you eat right and cure all your deficiencies, have your blood checked again. In all likelihood, your values will be in range and your hormones will balance out. You will look and feel a whole lot better
10) Hit the gym!

1458509227.0,6,100,129,"Forgive me if this borders on ranting. I am have a 6 year old son. He has a 100 mark exam tomorrow and these are some intense shower-thoughts.

I was an academic high-flyer and so were my parents. They were firm with me but gave me whatever freedom I asked for so I have no regrets about my upbringing. It was just another academically-intense neighborhood but I had plenty of access to a nice library and sports activities, so that was enough diversions from studies. End of the day, I think I would recommend my academic phases to others. (I did run into many several assholes in the form of teachers/professors but not in the manner of breaking me). I travelled all over, retain a strong love of learning even now and experienced good things in life.

My kid is 6 and studies in an ICSE school, class 1. Till age 3 he was in the US, where I got him several books from the library each week. During our daily walks, he was able to identify all the car logos, and from the license plates learnt to count till 1000. We moved to India midway and he joined LKG in a CBSE school. He had never held a pencil till then and his LKG classwork would be write single-digit numbers(0 to 9) 48 times on a page(Grid of 6x8). He could never grasp why he should get stuck on the same number when he could so easily move on. Pretty much, all his subjects were about repetition and he lost it. Bitch teacher gave him 5/50 in Maths in the annual exam and asked us to make him repeat LKG or take him elsewhere. We took him out and put him in a Montessori for UKG. He enjoyed it but did nothing in class, but thats how Montessori worked and that year he became a very proficient reader, blasting through story books.

We moved cities and put him in ICSE for Class 1. He suffered initially and made slow progress in writing. He grasps English fluently, understands most concepts in Math, me and wife spend a lot of time using the computer to teach him instead of the stupid textbooks. He is behind other kids in terms of lifetime hours spent writing, so while he is a voracious reader(into Enid Blyton, Roald Dahl) and fairly smart his grades are still close to bottom of the class.

Now he has a 2 hour exam tomorrow. In my lifetime, the first time I ever had a 100 mark test was in Class 6. My wife's friend put her kid into the state syllabus which is pretty dilute and hopeless saying she just wants her kid to live like a kid.

This is where we are at: Do we prepare him for the real world by letting him go through an intensive early-childhood curriculum? We have cut off TV, tablets, screens - given our kids love of reading, play with them as much as we can, give them the gift of time, enhance their studies with software. (So far we have never spent more than Rs.800 on our kids birthdays). I try to torrent/read every child-raising book I can get off the internet. We do all this because:

* School fees cost a bomb

* Quality of teachers are utter shit-ass. Typically most parents re-teach their kids and some try to send for extra coaching programs.

* Seats in good quality wholesome schools are rarer than an honest political party

* Difficult to find playmates in our locality who are not spoilt brats(addicted to junk food and devices, tantrum throwing monsters)

The other choice is to put kids in a non-CBSE school in Tamil Nadu, which means less academic stress but a shitty curriculum, half-literate teachers who know jackshit, maverick kids from mostly low-income homes and less-educated parents. I dont want to go for this option because I am not sure how kids raised with low-expectations turn out when they reach ages of 10-13: do they have enough internal control to deal with their hormones, gadgets, attention-deficiency as well as work on their academic drawbacks?

**TL:DR;** Choice 1: Let kids face early childhood pressure, supplement with parental attention/care 

Choice 2: Let kids grow in a chalta-hai academic environment and peers, get them to step up their game to face the real world once they reach 10+ years of age.

-----------------------------------
In December 2015, President Obama signed the Microbeads Free Waters Act, banning the use of plastic microbeads used as exfoliants in personal care products. As a previous director of the organization that first helped uncover this issue, I continue to be astonished by the massive amounts of plastic pollution that originate from a seemingly innocent act: washing our collective faces.

Winning on microbeads took a huge, national coalition of NGOs with a united strategic plan. The next iteration of that work has a new target: microfibers that come from washing synthetic clothing in washing machines.  

Oceanic gyres tend to eviscerate big plastics into smaller bits, and washing machines do the same — and even more efficiently. When you wash clothing made from synthetic materials such as polyester, tiny particles of plastic called microfibers are washed down the drain with the washing machine effluent. Microfiber pollution is one of the biggest sources of primary microplastic pollution. In a recent International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) report, washing clothing was found to be responsible for 33 percent of primary microplastic releases into the environment. Compare that to the effect of microbeads, which were banned for their paltry 2 percent contribution to watershed microplastic pollution.

For clothing brands, microfiber pollution represents an existential threat to their bottom line, and for outdoor companies, their pro-environment reputations.

**When you wash clothing made from synthetic materials such as polyester, tiny particles of plastic called microfibers are washed down the drain with the washing machine effluent.**

Why? Because fossil-fuel-derived, plastic textiles are becoming the go-to fabric of choice for sports and active lifestyle brands due to their performance attributes. Already, 60 percent of all clothing on earth is made of polyester, with even higher occurrences in activewear brands. But whether it’s yoga pants, fleece jackets or underwear, plastic clothes are the new normal — and are shedding massive amounts of persistent plastic pollutants into our shared waters and soil. Unfortunately, with increasing demand for synthetic fabrics, the problem is at risk of getting even worse.  

To give an idea of scale, it’s estimated more than 1.4 million trillion fibers are awash in the ocean, a number derived by George Leonard, chief scientist for the Ocean Conservancy, based on an extrapolation from existing data. Now, consider that government data shows more than 103 million washing machines are in the United States doing an average of eight to 10 loads of laundry per week. According to the scientific literature, each load can release between 1,900 fibers per load, to as many as 250,000 per fleece jacket, per wash.

**Microfibers are a huge source of pollution, but are they dangerous?**

It’s seriously doubtful we’re going to see a scientific study that demonstrates that animals eating plastic is a good thing. As such, many scientists agree there is cause for alarm and that a solution must be found.

What we do know is that plankton, mussels and clams eat fibers and can cause gut impaction and other serious digestive tract problems. We know one in four fish procured from a fish market in California has evidence of microfiber ingestion. We also know microfibers will attract and concentrate (up to a million times greater toxicity) other chemical pollutants present in water, and that after ingestion these toxins can leach from the plastic into an organism’s tissues. Some clothing is also treated with dangerous chemicals that will desorb into water over time as well.  

So, although we don’t know the ultimate human health connection implications yet from eating sea life, we know that larger organisms eat smaller ones, and that pollutants thus magnify up the food chain.

**So what are clothing brands doing about it?**

Forward-thinking brands have acknowledged microfiber pollution is real, and apparel company Patagonia has commissioned a study to look at their products’ contributions to the problem. But few brands have made any significant progress on mitigating their products’ impact on the environment. 

In the six years since the first seminal study demonstrating microfiber pollution was published, no clothing company has abandoned synthetic fibers for use in their products. Instead, we’ve seen an increased use of synthetic textiles, especially polyester. Brands love polyester and other synthetics for their performance attributes: they repel water, wick sweat, and the fabric stretches without getting stretched out. Although cheap to produce, polyester is twice as carbon-intensive than the next most carbon-intensive material, cotton.

Some brands, recognizing a way to solve the carbon problem, thought making clothing out of recycled plastic water and soda bottles would be a good idea. This became an overall trend for ""green activewear"" brands to tell a sustainability story. Although these efforts are well-intentioned, the effect on water and soil remains the same with regard to microfiber pollution.

It’s clear that many concerned companies examining the microplastics problem associated with clothes are still in the ‘head scratching’ phase.
As is often the case with so many environmental problems, the first solutions are ones that encourage individual actions and technical quick fixes over more complicated, systemic interventions. Although we at The Story of Stuff Project absolutely appreciate innovation and individuals’ desire to ""do good"" in the world, we’ve been in the environmental advocacy sphere long enough to be skeptical of ""sexy"" tech fixes that attempt to frame an issue as being solved ""if we all just do our part.""

Here are my thoughts on some solutions proposed so far:  

**Wash your synthetic clothes less**: We have to clean clothes eventually, which seems to indicate that clothing brands are still OK with some amount of fibers going into the environment. This strategy doesn’t address the systemic problem and places the burden on the consumer.

**Put a filter in a washing machine**: Again, this is the clothing industry looking for another industry to solve its problem. Technically, it’s difficult to put a filter inside a washing machine because the fibers it catches are so fine they end up stopping the machine from draining properly. This observation comes directly from the mouths of product developers at General Electric, with whom I’ve spoken at length.

**Put a filter outside of the washing machine**: 
This could work, but how on earth would you ever enforce it? This task seems just as hard as campaigning against all textile manufacturers, and again, it puts the burden on the public, not the producer.

**Use a filter bag inside the machine**: Recently, there has been a lot in the press around the Guppy Friend, a bag designed to stop microfiber solution by washing synthetic fabrics within the bag. This is a pretty cool stop-gap measure that allows citizens to ""do something."" I’d like this better if industry was subsidizing the cost of the bag and giving it away at point of purchase, rather than ""hoping"" people will buy them.
**
Put a fiber collector or innovative detergent in the machine**: This may have some promise, but again, how could anyone enforce this? Maybe a detergent could be invented that works as a coagulating agent that grabs all the fibers and leaves a ball of fibers at the end of a cycle. I’m spitballing, but if such a thing could be invented, you’d have to legislate that all detergent sold does this — and we’d need clothing companies to pay for the R&D that creates the product and support the legislative battle to pass the policy. Judging by how hard plastic-microbeads-loving companies fought common sense legislation, this would be very difficult to achieve.

**Stop using synthetic fabrics**: There are fabrics from natural sources that could be used more widely — bamboo, for example, can be spun into fabric in a closed loop system (where chemicals used to break down the cellulosic fiber into a usable form are captured, re-used and never enter the environment). Bamboo has a lot of pluses, and also has many of the performance attributes that polyester does.

**Update all developed country sewage treatment to tertiary filtration with the final effluent treated by cloth filters before it’s discharged**: Yes, this ultimately could stop fibers from getting into watersheds but it would require billions of dollars of infrastructure spending, and it raises other issues, such as what to do about biosolids. The only way to make this work equitably would be to pass laws that require clothing manufacturers to pay a portion of their revenue, based on size, to a fund the updates the treatment process and offset the loss of revenue derived from selling fertilizers. There are several jurisdictional barriers to work through, but what concerns me most is that eventually, a litigation-oriented nonprofit likely will sue wastewater agencies for discharging plastic fibers in violation of the Clean Water Act or some other nuanced legal theory.

**Coat textiles with a treatment that prevents shedding**: This is an interesting idea some clothing brands are assessing. Many questions remain, namely: How long would a coating last? Is the coating environmentally benign? However difficult, this is the solution I like the most so far, because it puts the burden of solving the pollution problem on the front end and on the industry responsible for creating the problem in the first place.

It’s clear that many concerned companies examining the microplastics problem associated with clothes are still in the ""head scratching"" phase. No clothing brand intended for their synthetic products to be discharged into the environment. Now that they know, they must step up and tackle the problem. As advocates and concerned citizens, we must work hard to listen to the brands but also to guide their proposed solutions and push for systemic fixes.

“I get to see very less of sunlight for the most part of the year. Need to rise very early and by 7 a.m I join my abba (father). I help him in making carpets. Our room is very small and it gets difficult for both of us to fit in. Mostly, it remains dark as there is only one window for the light to come in. Carpets are not easy to make. It takes us around 12 hours every day and I hardly get a sense of time. My eyes hurt and the back aches a lot. Sometimes I hear my friends playing outside. I feel such an urge to join them. But it never happens. We are very poor and if I do not make carpets with Abba, we will not be able to have food on our plates. My studies have also stopped. I used to love going to school as I had so my friends there. But had to drop out after the second standard because my parents were not able to afford my education any further.”


As shared by 13-year-old Sahil from Budgam, Kashmir







**I. STATE OF EDUCATION IN JAMMU & KASHMIR**



**One of the unseen causality of militancy in the state of Jammu & Kashmir has been the education sector.** Children are thus one of the most affected cohorts, vulnerable to the impact of these conflicts with breakdown of families and loss of social protection system.



There are innumerable evidences that flag the dire state of education in the state of Jammu & Kashmir.



**1. The state of Jammu & Kashmir has 6th lowest state-wise literacy rate in India at 68.74% which is 5.30 percentage points below national average at 74.04%.**


[Comparison of Literacy Rates of Top 5 States, BIMARU States, and Jammu & Kashmir (2011 Census)!](https://imgur.com/2albrpG)


Thus, the literacy rate of the state of Jammu & Kashmir is not only below national average, but is comparable to literacy rates of BIMARU states.


**2. Net Enrolment Ratio (N.E.R.) has also consistently been below not only the national average but also that of BIMARU states.**


[N.E.R. of BIMARU states and Jammu & Kashmir!](https://imgur.com/DVQtV4e)


**3. The state also fares very poorly on other performance indicators such as percentage of schools having computers or access to electricity.**

**II. WHO ARE WE AND WHAT DO WE DO?**


Child Rights and You commonly abbreviated as CRY (https://www.cry.org), is a non-profit organisation in India, which aims to restore children's rights. CRY works to uplift thousands of underprivileged Indian children denied of basic rights by working across levels - from direct action, advocacy, mobilising public opinion to policy change.

Our Impact:

* Among 3,35,000 school going children, 9600 children who dropped out, between 6 and 18 years were re enrolled.
* We helped set up 13 new schools and facilitated the upgrade of 30 existing schools from primary to higher levels.
* We ensured that 33,000 children were immunized within their 1st year.
* We identified 21,600 children with varying degrees of malnutrition, 7000 among them were identified as severely malnourished (SAM) and were brought under the safety net.
* **Over the last 30 years, we impacted the lives of more than 20,00,000 children across 20 states in India.**

**III. OUR WORK IN JAMMU & KASHMIR AND SUCCESS STORIES**


Currently, the organization has two partners in Jammu & Kashmir, namely - Jammu and Kashmir Association of Social Workers (JKASW) and Koshish that aim towards bettering lives in the districts of Bandipora & Baramulla, and Budgam & Ganderbal respectively. The projects roughly cover a total child population of 16,705 which includes 8,419 males and 8,286 females.


We, with the help of its on-ground partners in the state, runs Child Activity Centers (CACs) that provide a safe space for these kids to play, talk about their fears and issues and express themselves. These centers are meant for never-been to school children, dropouts, children on the verge of being drop out and child labourers. Using light forms of entertainment like music, theatre, drawing and sports, these centers actively work to engage children in various activities, with the aim of restoring some level of normalcy in their lives.


The goal for CRY and CACs is to provide children with the necessary support and motivation and help them get through their tough times.


2 of our Success Stories are:


**1. Sumi Aziz:**


Sumi Aziz, lives in Nagbal village, where accessibility to the basic facilities of living is very meager and the community people have to move to the main town to buy the basic amenities for their day to day living.Sumi never joined school as she was just 1 year old when her mother passed away. Her father and brothers were labourers trying to make ends meet for their family. Her sister also dropped out of school in order to take care of household responsibilities. There was no one in Sumi’s family who could teach her the importance of education and school enrollment.


The CAC representatives identified Sumi as one of the many children who have never been to school. Meetings were conducted to educate the family first, the importance of going to school as well as to motivate Sumi to let her interest rise up in the learning process. The learning from the sessions at the CAC had developed swiftness in her learning interests and very soon she was able to get admitted to a regular school. The CAC representatives have also been actively encouraging Sumi’s elder sister Amina to get involved in the process.


**2. Nighat:**


Nighat had never been to school prior to CRY and Koshish’s intervention. The reason being, the family members being bust with their own work schedule and the school being almost 3 kilometers away from her house. The route to school from Nighat’s house was in the periphery of forest land and was unsafe for a child to go to school alone without any elder accompanying her. CRY and Koshish’s team held various meetings to get the child acquainted with basic forms of education and the fact the CAC center was very close to her home convinced Nighat’s family to opt in for the learning process. A survey was conducted to identify more children in the vicinity and a program was organized to make sure that all the children went to school together thereby eliminating the dependency on family members.

**Food (Wastage, Inflation)**

Shin Chan used to separate out *shimla mirch* from his meals and throw them in the trash because he didn’t like them. And also because he didn’t understand the economics of food wastage and inflation in modern India. A review by Economic Times last week [reported](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/food-wastage-can-cost-a-family-rs-80-lakh/articleshow/53127874.cms) that if the average family reduces food wastage by half and invested the savings at 10% returns, it can add up to ₹21 lakh in 30 years. However, that is not a static number since food prices tend to rise with inflation. And the inflation numbers for June [back](http://www.firstpost.com/business/cpi-inflation-at-5-77-should-ring-alarm-bells-for-new-rbi-governor-2890602.html) that claim. Food inflation was at 7.79% in June, up from 7.47% in May. Specifically, inflation in vegetables was about 14% in June, up from about 10% in May. So the next time your mother tells you to eat your vegetables, just pinch your nose and eat those godforsaken things that masquerade around as food. While that number only looks at food prices, consumer inflation which looks at prices in general stayed pretty much the same at 5.77%. Far from being a reason to pop open the champagne, “pretty much the same” still means a 22-month high. That 5.77% number should ring alarm bells for the RBI because if it crosses 6%, the RBI is required to explain to the government why it failed at keeping inflation in check. 

  

**The Business Of Cricket**

Baba Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. But in India, you could easily replace religion with cricket in that sentence and it would still stand true. With cows being the only thing more sacred that cricket in India, all that religious obsession over cricket has made gods out of cricketers. And cricketers have raked in the money as they’ve turned themselves into a brand. Just a short list of businesses that Virat Kohli owns partly or entirely includes a chain of fitness centers, a clothing line, a tennis team, a football team, a wrestling team and a sport-based social network. And he’s adding one more to that list. Mr. Kohli is now a co-owner of his own [fanclub](http://yourstory.com/2016/05/virat-kohli-fanbox-privyplex/) called ‘Virat FanBox’ that sells a branded edition of Moto G smartphone that comes preloaded with his app that gives users exclusive access to him. With a price tag of ₹16,999, Virat FanBox also gets you a signed miniature cricket bat and one-year subscription to his fanclub. And of course, it has to come in a box, otherwise the name wouldn’t make sense. Time for a confession - that was news in May, not last week. Last Week In Indian Economy, bringing you week-old, and sometimes even months-old stale and smelly news since 2016. More recently though, last week Dhoni’s apparel and footwear brand Seven [marked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/dhonis-brand-seven-grosses-over-2-5-million-in-three-months/articleshow/53221126.cms) a milestone of $2.5 million in sales just three months after launching. 

  

**Gotta Catch ‘Em All!**

It started with Angry Birds. Then came Flappy Bird. And now we don’t exactly have another bird, but we have Pokemon Go. The augmented reality mobile gaming app has instantly catapulted to so much popularity that it is now bigger than Tinder and Twitter. The internet managed to give it the hug of death as well. With more than 15 million (official) [downloads](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pokemon-nintendo-business-implications-augmented-000000901.html) from 26 countries, the mobile game had to stop new players from signing up because the traffic had pushed its servers over the edge. Perhaps more noteworthy is the fact that it has managed to do the impossible. It’s managed to bring out hordes of nerds from underground basements to open-air gardens and parks, many of whom are just finding out that they are allergic to sunlight. It’s also managed to bring the stock of Nintendo up by 106% in the past two weeks. Nintendo owns 32% of The Pokemon Company, which is reportedly [making](http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-chasing-investors-send-nintendo-shares-soaring-1468228206) an estimated $1.6 million per day in revenues from the game. For Nintendo, this couldn’t have come at a better time - the company’s profits fell by 61% last year due to weak sales of its console Wii U.

  

**Let The Games Begin! Again.**

The earnings season is here again. Which means newspapers don’t have to worry about filling empty space anymore. This earnings season was kicked off by three high profile names - Infosys, TCS and Reliance. As oil prices recover in the global market, petrochemical major Reliance [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/ril-q1-beats-estimates-profit4-grm-surges-to-361150bbl_7047161.html) a 4.4% increase in net profits beating expectations. The company’s currently busy preparing for a commercial launch of Reliance Jio, it’s foray into the telecom business. Moving over to names in the IT industry that reported earnings - When Donald Trump rants about foreigners stealing American jobs, this is part of what he’s unknowingly referring to. Both IT companies, TCS and Infosys are in the business of helping multinational corporations outsource their work and business is booming. But only for one of them. TCS [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tcs-q1-results-idINKCN0ZU15T) a better-than-expected 11% rise in net profit but dalal street had no love for the stock which remained flat. Perhaps due to fears over Brexit since the UK contributes 15% to the company’s revenue while the rest of Europe adds another 12%. On the other hand, while Infosys did post a 13% rise in profits, but it [lowered](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/infosys-posts-lacklustre-q1-result-slashes-outlook-2917009/) its predictions of the profit it might report throughout the rest of the year. Definitely no love for the stock which is down over 8%.

* Former RBI Governor D. Subbarao’s memoir called “Who moved my interest rate?” hit the stands last week. In the tell-all book that may cause some embarrassment to prominent leaders in the government, Subbarao [gives](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/d-subbaraos-memoirs-manmohan-singh-ignored-finance-minister-on-subbarao-term/article8850380.ece) all the dirty details of his stressful relationships with then finance ministers P. Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee. Since this book comes 3 years after his term as Governor ended, all we have to do now is wait 3 years for Raghuram Rajan (or “R3” as the social media calls him) to write a book revealing the real reason behind his resignation. Mark your calendars for 2019.

Ugh, not another robots are taking over our jobs story. Although all the jobs at risk are at the bottom of the pyramid, this is alarming since the $160 billion IT industry is one of India’s biggest employers. We already have an R3, won’t be long before we get an R2-D2 as well. 
  

* Air India is certainly not a private sector airliner. But a lot of bureaucrats treat Air India like their own private airliner.

So, Air India may lose the privilege of being sole carrier of government babus. Although, was it really a privilege before this? 
  
* You know how the bad guys in every movie always carry black suitcases full of cash to a drug deal? How much cash do you reckon is inside those suitcases?

**WANTED: RBI Governor**

Alright, you knew this was coming. You don’t live under a rock. You’ve heard about this. We have had wall to wall coverage of this story since it broke. And as the most important economic story of the week, it has to be talked about here. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan does not [want](http://in.reuters.com/article/rbi-chief-rajan-quit-idINKCN0Z50N2) a second term. In a message to the RBI staff that was released on the central bank’s website, Rajan has stated his desire to not continue as the governor. Instead, he’s going back to his old teaching job in the US. Apparently, the governor was very much interested in serving a second term. But getting reappointed would mean that he would have to maneuver the delicate political minefield. And Rajan was unwilling to get down and dirty in the intricate interlockings of Indian politics, which has now become more complex than the plot of Game of Thrones. And so, the House of Rajan will now be leaving the show in September. This decision to not continue marks a political victory for the campaign against his reappointment, which was led by Subramanium from the House of Swamy. 


**Flying Higher**

Rule 4/20 is the rule that states you must smoke a little something when the clock strikes 4:20. Rule 5/20 is not as exciting or fun, and only applies to the Indian aviation industry. The 5/20 rule states that any Indian airliner must have 5 years of experience flying domestic routes and must own 20 aircrafts before it can operate any international routes. It might sound like redundant regulation to you, but that’s not how the folks at Jet Airways and SpiceJet see this. To incumbent airliners who already satisfy the rule, this is hugely beneficial since it removes competition on international routes. But to newer airliners like Air Asia who don’t satisfy the rule, this is a lost business opportunity. But a new civil aviation policy approved last week [removed](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-airlines-rules-idINKCN0Z110J) the 5-year experience requirement, however the 20 aircraft rule still stands, making it the 0/20 rule. A big round of FDI reforms has also eased rules for FDI in the aviation industry.

**EU & Britain - The Big Divorce**

Britain, the real reason why Indians love tea and cricket, is going through a messy divorce. In a nation-wide referendum, Britishers will soon vote if they want the country to leave the European Union or stay in the European Union. A popular argument for staying in the EU cites the disastrous effects that the British economy is expected to experience if it leaves. The UK Treasury [says](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/talking-point-brexit-and-indian-markets/article8748796.ece) that if Britain leaves, inflation will spike, unemployment will rise, and GDP growth might be 6% lower. But let’s be honest, most of you can’t be bothered to keep up with even the Indian economy. The news is boring, uninteresting, mundane and all the other synonyms of boring. And here is a story asking you to care about the British economy. So before you tune out, know that you should care about this because the global economy is a series of dominos, and one of them might fall next week. Most of the world is urging Britain to stay in the EU. But really, the only evidence that anyone needs to take into consideration is - Donald Trump supports Britain leaving the EU. And that right there, should be enough information for the British people to know which way to vote.

**STILL WANTED: RBI Governor**

You know what? We haven’t talked about this enough. This story deserves another look. The big news of Rajan’s departure was dropped in an open letter that Rajan wrote to the RBI staff. And it caught everyone off-guard, including the government. While Rajan gets ready for his exit interview, the government is busy looking at résumés of candidates to fill his position. The news of his departure isn’t even a week old, but the race to replace him is already starting to heat up. The shortlist has as many as [seven](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/seven-names-on-long-list-to-replace-rbis-rajan-official-1420762) people, but the frontrunner right now is Arundhati Bhattacharya, a high-profile banker who has been at the helm of India's largest lender - State Bank of India. If you think you can make the shortlist, send your CV to: Sansad Marg, Janpath, New Delhi, Delhi 110001. Either way, get ready to bid farewell to Rajan. It sure was good while it lasted, wasn’t it? But like all good things in life, it had to come to an end. Rajan, we had a lot of fun together, didn’t we? Remember when you cut consumer inflation from a high of 11.16% to a low of 3.69%? Yeah.. Good times. And remember when you increased the foreign exchange reserves from $275 billion to $363 billion? Yeah... Those were the days. I’m sorry, I think I need some time alone.

* To stop cheap imports of foreign wheat from messing with the domestic wheat market which employs a lot of farmers, the government levies a duty of 25% on all wheat imports.

One can only imagine how frustrated Bezos must’ve felt when they told him that last week, India [eased](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/govt-to-hold-briefing-on-fdi-rules-today/article8751887.ece) FDI rules for 9 industries including aviation, defense, pharma and food processing. Can you guess which industry didn’t make the cut?

* Larsen & Toubro has [bagged](http://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-qatar-idINKCN0YS0P2) a $135 million contract to build a stadium in Qatar for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. $135 million is a lot of money. Qatar’s economy is largely based on oil and prices are not exactly ideal right now. So if you’re wondering how they are even paying for the stadium, wonder no more - The Gulf country has cut planned spending on building hospitals by about two-thirds in 2016 following the drop in oil prices to keep expenditure on its World Cup-related projects unchanged. Those are some solid priorities right there.

* It hasn’t even been a week since the news of Rajan’s departure broke and bad news has already [started](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/wpi-inflation-rises-to-079-in-may-on-higher-food-prices/article8727957.ece) rolling in. Consumer inflation, which halved during Rajan’s tenure, came in at a 21-month high of 5.76% for the month of May. Food prices for the month went up by 7.55%, also a 21-month high. Wholesale inflation, which was negative until two months ago, came in at a 19-month high of 0.76%. RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

###Footnote Stories

They say there aren’t any free lunches in the world. But at least you don’t get the bill after a free lunch. However, that might soon change. Due to some ambiguity in the GST bill as it stands right now, you could [potentially](http://www.businessinsider.in/Nothing-is-going-to-come-for-free-after-GST-is-implemented-Heres-why/articleshow/52775662.cms) end up paying taxes on things that you get for free. While it is highly unlikely that this goes through, this could spell the end of all those ‘Buy One, Get One Free’ offers that businesses use to kill two birds with one stone - get some solid goodwill with consumers, and get rid of old merchandise.

For a lot of Indians, the festival that brings families and friends together is no longer Diwali. It’s the festival of IPL. The sporting franchise recently concluded its 9th season this year. And it [raked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ipl-is-a-money-spinner-as-it-amasses-rs-2500-crore-in-its-ninth-season/articleshow/52720049.cms) in ₹2,500 crore in overall revenue from advertising, sponsorships, ticket sales and merchandising. A big chunk of that money, as much as ₹1,100 crore went to Sony as the official broadcaster of the IPL. With that kind of cash, it doesn’t matter which team you support or which team wins, the executives at Sony always win.

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

The world spends millions or billions of dollars on Olympics every two years (counting Winter Olympics also). Then, consider all the other sporting and artistic events which happen around the world, which run into billions of dollars every year, year after year, and nobody questions them. How are they justified? Why don't we stop watching movies and instead everybody in the world pool that money to feed the poor?

The explanation is that humans need more than just food, clothing and shelter to live their lives. They need something that appeals to their intellectual, emotional, spiritual aspirations also. For this purpose, humans can and do spend a lot more money and materials than they spend for basic needs. That is not ""waste"". That is what being a human is all about. It is stupid to question why a country or community spends more on non-basic needs when many of its citizens don't have their basic needs met.

1513022533.0,6,33,65,"Recently I read a post that said Saptarishi Nagamani was the inventor of BITCOIN, and bitcoin meant Black Income Target Currency Of INdia. This post denoted that a certain Mitron was working with an Indian Engineer in NASA, yeah, NASA to bring back all the black money back to India by making Bitcoin obsolete in 2019. This hell of a master plan made me think of an Utopia(?) where if the entire world was Indianised instead of being westernised. This is a work of fiction and any resemblance to the real world is the result of you listening to a Whatsapp forward from your mama in Gelf.

Those who know or have watched ""Man in the High Castle"" or have played ""Wolfenstein"" would be able to understand the background. Now let us start with food, major brands like KFC, McD, Domino's would be well and present, but with a little twist of their own. KFC would expand to Kozhis(chicken in tamil) From Chellappan, McD would be Marwari Chintu's Dokla and Domino's would be Damini's. The main ingredient of Maharaja Burger would be chaat masala, instead of french fries you would get plantain bajji and onion in/as your Piri Piri toppings. Italy would be renamed to Idly and instead of inventing pasta and pizza, they would have invented Kaara payasta and ghee burst pizza with brinjal and Moringa toppings.World would be mad about Kaapi and Chaaya. Americapuram would be mad about Filter Kaapi and teens especially would love Pumpkin spice sukku kaapi, and England would go rama over kattan chaaya. Kattan chaaya would have so much demand that the Queen herself would personally come in her Vimana to India without even Kamal inviting her for Marudhanaayagam.

Ice cream as we know it would have become Aish cream, a cold eatable made famous by Aishwarya Rai. Sambar and Roti are now available in 143 countries which was the result of Oregon Sambar rush in the 19th century. Roti began its way to become a food loved by the whole world during the international frisbee tournament when Indians introduced the thought of eating a food that was similar to the frisbee. It is also said that dosai was the result of a similar event, but it was inspired from a UFO on the sky. India also holds the patent to Venn pongal, as it is now identified as an anesthetic capable of making people sleep for extended hours.
With Indian food changing the world with its cultural footprint, international politics also saw a major change. During the 18th century, ""The Boston chaaya party of 1773"" saw the Americapuram natives protest against Britishpettai people. When India took over the Britishpettai and conquered Londonoor, the invasion was stopped by one special tree. The tree our ancient ancestors held so highly, in the Queen Elizabethammal's garden, there was a Thulasi maadam or a Thulasi plant which the queen used to take one leaf everyday morning. Looking at the clean habits of Elizabethammal, we retreated from Britishpettai. 

But things were not the same when we conqured americapuram, because the world believed that Americapuram was discovered by Christappan Columbar, while it was actually discovered by Leif Ericksapillai. Being angry at this lie, we took over Americapuram, but after we gave independence to them, it fell into hands of evil Sarkar Mishter. Barrackavetti Obamasingh. But his Raja sabai was over thrown by the white haired knight Thiruvalar. Trumpanandam with the help of Thiru.Thadimayir Kutin from Russiapradesh. But India is still unable to come to terms with Bakisthan and often this is emotion is seen coming out during the Gillidhanda match between India-Bakisthan. India has been working for world peace by often conducting sabhas and pattimandrams and thiruvizhas. But North Koreanadu alone is often giving threats against the world, though its unclear why North Koreanadu is angry on the world, most people believe that it originated when our Mitron ignored Jing Jong Jil when he asked ""Kaapi shaaptela mama?"" during one of the world peace sabhas. Though India has been struggling a lot to keep up world peace, Its efforts do not go in vain as saami kuththam is sure to do the right thing in the end.

India has been a real influencer of Pop culture and Entertainment of the world. Like the recent Despasita was inspired from our holy Ramayana, which sings the greatness about the female lead of Ramayana. Many Paapu singers tour all over the world. This touring sparked the Harmoniya potti renaissance among youngsters globally. “Avengergal: Raasi Mandhira kal” is the next installment of the famed Avengergal comics which themselves were inspired by Mahabaratha. While a smilar comic movie called, Justice Logam failed the box office, it is expected that the animated version of Batmani, set in the aaghragaraththu era to become a super hit. Famous comic characters like Naruto Usilamani from Naruto, Gopu from Dragon Paal A2, Aasha from Porukimon have references to our old literary works. 

The Mastersamayal kaar is a famous show that is taking the world by the storm. Though most times the, finalist is Thachchi Mammu, now and then Vada Paav and Paani Poori wins. Apart from food and digital beings, india has also flipped the world with its fashion sense. Dhupatta has been widely recommended as the multipurpose cloth of the century and also has to said prevent rape. Now Lungi brands flash across the New Yokoor’s Times Roundtana, and fancy panchakachams are the fad. Watches are yesterday’s fashion as kaapu takes its place.

Sports and games has always been a difficult field for India. India has always suffered from losing to NRIs in other countries. Like Michael Phelppadurai has won so much gold that he need not take any dowry from his father-in-mamanar. Also twin sisters, Serina Valli.M and Venus Valli.M keep winning the tennis tournaments. Every year Ashes happens at Uttarkhand where the teams of Britishpettai and Australiacherry get together to do Gangasnanam and let go of the ashes into the ganga river for them to reach Heaven after life. Only place where India shines is Yoga competitions as a Yogi who is said to be living for 400 years wins all the competitions. He claims his Patanjali formula makes him youthful.

Things would have been so much fun if the world was Indianized. Let me know your thoughts on this. Would be happy to write a second part if people are interested.

**Edit:** Since everyone is asking for my blog here, here it is.  
https://themadraspaiyan.wordpress.com

But over the past few months I've been completely ignoring my blog and post only on Facebook. But I guess I'll be updating my blog again soon. Thanks for the welcoming guys. ",,Indianzied World,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7j1rqh/indianzied_world/
1452809809.0,6,186,113,"Previous thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/40xlky/killing_animals_for_bakrid_is_okay_but_jalikattu/
I think this is more than just minority appeasement. This is about how flawed our judicial system is. Also consider sallu bhai's case. What chance does a common man have against such hypocritical judiciary. 

EDIT: I have added my comment to elaborate the post, which you should read before believing in your false claims.

They have to regulate the instances which torture the animal. Not Ban the sport itself. But, read through the following for a deep insight into what jallikattu is all about.
> The Supreme Court of India has banned jallikattu. I am a vegetarian and defend animal rights. However, I see this judgment as an attack on Indian heritage. If the cruelty to animals is the real concern, why not ban halal slaughter first and then killing of any animal for meat before targeting jallikattu? There is no greater hypocrisy than tolerating the slaughter of millions of cattle by the meat industry while taking a holier than thou attitude toward jallikattu. The double standards of PETA and Indian SC are appalling. 
> 
> Indian judicial system is a joke. Literally millions of cases are pending for decades without any hope that the litigants would get justice. A woman who is a victim of polygamy cannot hope to receive any justice from this system. Corrupt politicians who have amassed billions are rarely punished. Yet, this pathetic institution overzealously bans a traditional sport. Martial castes, please take an antagonistic stance toward the SC judgment.
> 
> **Native breeds as a factor**
> 
> There were 130 or so cattle breeds in India 100 years ago and now there are only 37. Unless we engage with the traditional livestock keepers and support them, we will lose these breeds as well as lay the ground for commercial cattle based dairies and slaughter houses to dominate the country
> 
> Native cattle have evolved over millennia, adapting to the local environmental conditions. They are an integral part of farming, especially for small and marginal farmers as they serve multiple purposes like ploughing, transportation, source for farmyard manure. The native cattle are both an input as well as insurance to the livestock keepers. 
> 
> **Why Jallikattu matters**
> 
> Stud bulls are reared by people for jallikattu. The ones that win are much in demand for servicing the cows. Small farmers cannot afford to keep stud bulls, so each village has a common temple bull which services the cows of the village. Jallikattu is the show where bulls are brought and exhibited. The ones which are most agile (and virile) are preferred by farmers. The calves from such bulls are in demand.
> 
> Stud bulls need to be alert, virile, and agile. In the peak of their reproductive period, they need to secrete the necessary male hormones and experience adrenalin rushes and pumping hearts. They need this for them to be virile. This is in the interest of the species as selective breeding is done to propagate the species. Stud bulls are used for jallikattu and mating only. Experienced bulls enjoy the situation and display a well thought out exit from the sport. Many of them show off by shaking their heads as a warning. This shows their familiarity with the Jallikattu event.
> 
> Native cows do not yield as much milk as the imported breeds. So they don’t have a supportive or sponsored breeding programme. Artificial means are not adopted for native breeds. So as a fall out of the banning of jallikattu, they will soon fade away and become extinct.
> 
> Under article 48 of the constitution of India the state has to endeavour to preserve and improve the breeds and prevent slaughter of cows and calves and other draught and milk cattle. Hence the Union government has to intervene in this issue.
> 
> According to principles 1, 2 & 3 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to which India is a signatory state, livestock keepers are creators of breeds and custodians of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture; livestock keepers and the sustainable use of traditional breeds are dependent on the conservation of their respective ecosystems; traditional breeds represent collective property, they are the products of indigenous knowledge and the cultural expression of livestock keepers.
> 
> **Why is there so much opposition to jallikattu?**
> 
> There are two angles to the opposition.
> 
> First is the urban disconnect with rural India and all that it entails. 
>
> Policies are made by city folk. If we look at media reports over the last decade or so, every headline screams about injuries in a jallikattu event. The focus of the urban editors and reporters has always been on sensationalizing news and grabbing eyeballs. Fed with this constant diet over a decade, it’s no surprise that so many internet warriors are shouting about jallikattu.
> 
> In a year, there are 10,000 instances of a bull leaving the vaadi vaasal (gate) during jallikattu. Of the thousands of players who take part, hardly 50-100 get injured in a year, and deaths are much much less. The number of villagers who lose their lives to snake bites is easily a few hundred a year.
> 
> The second group is the dairy lobby, which wants all native breeds to be eradicated. Events like jallikattu throw a spanner in their plans of creating commercial dairy farms with imported breeds just like in the West.
> 
> Beef exporters also benefit from a ban on jallikattu and other events. Farmers bring their cattle to be sold in weekly/monthly and annual shandies. Brokers will take the cattle from the farmers and hold them to be displayed to prospective buyers. Buyers fall into 3-4 categories: (1) The jallikattu enthusiast who will buy the bulls and male calves mostly; (2) Buyers of oxen for farming/transport; (3) Buyers of cows for breeding and household usage; (4) Beef traders who are mostly if not all agents of export companies and slaughter houses based in Kerala. They buy all cattle as they are only interested in meat.
> 
> When a ban on jallikattu is in place, the simple supply-demand equation gets skewed. There are no takers in the first category, which means the bulls will only sought by the fourth category i.e. beef traders. With no demand from jallikattu enthusiasts, the price of such prized bulls falls to rock bottom. By killing the market for bulls to be used in jallikattu, the animal rights activists are directly responsible for sending them to slaughter. There is a huge demand for Bos Indicusvariety beef in the Gulf, Malaysia and Western countries. It is considered an exotic and healthy meat, just like country chicken.
>
> **Does it harm the bull?**
> 
> It is said that cruelty is meted out to animals by giving them alcohol, prodding and twisting their tails etc, that organisers beat the bulls, stuffing something pungent in their nostrils, confine them in a dark, suffocating place in order to enrage them.
> 
> The reality is different. Amidst all the regulations and scrutiny, which bull owner will risk giving alcohol to the bulls? Glucose water is given to them for stamina. Out of the 10,000 instances of bulls let out a year, the anti-jallikattu activists have produced images/videos of may be 7-8 bulls where an offence might have taken place. They have the power to identify the owner and take action against him under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Each bull is registered with the authorities, with photographs as well as the owner’s information.
> The sport consists of holding on to the hump of the bull and running along with it for a given distance usually about 20-30 meters which is covered in barely 10-20 seconds
>
> Every rule has an exception. We regulate to curtail the exceptions, but not to end the sport. The approach of the activists from day one has been to end jallikattu at any cost.
> 
> **Are there other means of conserving the breeds?**
> 
> Each breed has evolved over several millennia and in a distinct way. One method of breed conservation will not work in another area, with another breed. Every place in the world where indigenous people have lived with their livestock, there are celebratory showcase events post-harvest like kambala buffalo water racing in the Dakshin Kannada region, Ongole stone pulling in central and coastal Andhra, rekla races in western Tamil Nadu and Theni, bailgada in Maharashtra with the Killari breed. Each event has evolved locally and has stood the test of time. In-situ conservation is the best method for conserving any breed. The lifetime and health of the species is extended only due to such events.
> .
> 
> **A ban will be fatal**
> 
> Under the Convention on Biological Diversity and heritage status practices worldwide, it is customary that these ancient traditional practices are left as they are but with rules to organise and regulate them. If we lose our breeds and import foreign breeds, multinational commercial companies will dominate the dairy industry in India. The livelihood of millions in rural India is at stake here.
> 
> People who want a ban on jallikattu are far removed from village life and do not know how this chain works.
> 
> The Supreme Court and the Government of India needs to look at the big picture behind jallikattu. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) supports traditional practices to keep the chain intact and thus enable conservation of native breeds. As an ancient nation with an ancient practice going back millennia, jallikattu should be preserved. There is no torture of any animal of any sort that takes place during the sport and the evidence of this can be seen from live media telecasts. The time a bull spends engaged in the sport is less than 30 seconds. Rules have to be implemented to enhance the safety of the animals and men.

no friends, never been in relationship, i have tried but could never make friends, couldn't relate to anyone or anything, still tried to hang around but got told to fuck off explicitly, this happened multiple times before i gave up.

no talent, no hobbies, no interests, no passions, neither book smart, nor street smart. No discernible qualities...

have no meaningful relationships to anyone including parents, but even they have made it clear that they aren't very fond of me. They would've kicked me out a long time ago if not for keeping up social appearances, but they've made it clear that their tolerance is limiting.

Never had a drink, Never smoked, Never had any habits, Never watched enough movies, Didn't play much sports, most of my lifetime has been passed just sitting emptily...

Have somehow managed to get dealt every bad genetics card, yet have no disease to blame them for..

Fugly looking... I know, its not how you  look but... I've tried to dress well, groom well, put up a positive attitude... and got shut down pretty quickly... yeah definitely the face is a problem. You know how people say punchable faces, i have it (as i said every bad genetic traits that can't be blamed on some disease/disorder.. I have it). Pretty sure got shut out of few job interviews just by my looks.

Can't get a company job, not smart enough to get jobs through exams, blocked by my own fatness out of physical jobs. My own degree has become a hurdle as people reject me out of low end jobs purely out of suspicion that i might quit. -_-

Never had a meaningful conversation with another human being before, never had any pets... So... no meaningful connection with another living being...

I did try to run away thinking of restarting, a few years back... only to realize how fucking clueless i was, i did ask around few random shops and hotels for job, they took one look at me and told me to fuck off, realized that even poor people are well connected among themselves and its pretty much impossible for some one like me to find work... returned to parents in shame. I know there are lot of people in worse situations, but i clearly lack survivability. So...

(I have no clue how people just move to new places and make a living...)

I would've liked to think i had some mental issues, but pretty much sure i'm just stupid as fuck. From the last couple of years i seem to have lost it, because i'm now unable to stand and talk to another person as my heart starts racing so fast, some times feels like i'm having a heart attack just by being around others (This also have become a problem for me, because i can't tell if i'm having a real heart attack from my obesity or it's just the fear of talking to others). My hands literally start shaking just answering even marketing phone calls, i can't utter a complete sentence at another person before my mouth runs dry and words get stuck in my throat... So i just run away and hide or try to avoid any conversation altogether.

I used to think i was good at programming and technology, only to realize i knew fuck all as i studied further, add some unpleasant experiences surrounding that which i don't even want to recall, it pretty much broke me down, from last few months i have stopped applying, i have sopped trying. This has gotten so bad that even when i said fuck it  let me just give it another go, i am unable to do it.. like physically unable.. you know how people struggle while being mind controlled but ultimately give in and fail, its a feeling like that, i have literally tried to use my hands to push my own leg out the door and something within myself was disallowing me to go through with that. So, I gave up  and have shut myself in.

There is a constant looming thought of just offing myself and spare everyone the hassle of standing me, but i'm positively affirmative that i don't have the courage for it.

I mean i'm not sure why i am putting it all up, probably because i have only a few days left before i even run out of internet, my folks have even decided to move (yeah i never had a permanent address either which is making things a bit more complex). I am already not able to get a living in a big city, pretty sure i will have absolutely jack shit if i follow them to the small town (even they, are clear about not wanting me to come with them). I mean if i were to believe in every movie i've watched and every story i've read, you don't go move to a small town to get things done, that move is pretty much reserved for getting away from things. Since, I need things to gravitate towards, i shouldn't move.. right??

So basically, never did anything, never connected with anyone, Never traveled anywhere, Have nothing to look forward to, Have no motivation to do anything, Everything seems pointless... whats the point of just being without any purpose or direction? Or no resource to fill the void of having no purpose or direction? 
Is such a life even worth living? Am i worth existing??

FUCK!!

___________________________________________________
So,... I kindah have decided to make myself a purpose, thought i should start with improving my body first, but i can't afford gym membership (because that's the fastest way i could think of... i know i could just walk and jog for free, but those things takes years and i don't have years to spare). I am willing to work for it, is there anyway i can get something that will be able to pay for the following things?

A safe place to stay/sleep  .

Food to eat.

a gym membership

phone/internet

Commuting

spare money for getting clothes and stuff ( i don't have much to begin with, if i take working out seriously, i probably gonna need them).

I am willing to go anywhere as long as these things can be afforded from what i make at where i will be (or you don't have to pay me anything if you can provide me these things in exchange for the work).

I  can understand English, Hindi and kannada.

I AM good with computers than the average person though... if that matters, and probably the only thing i can be sure of with all the self-confidence i have left.

1485418103.0,6,6,5,"A link to the report by Animal Welfare Board of India member and animal welfare advocate Manoj Oswal (credit to upload by Firstpost.com):

https://www.scribd.com/document/337518407/Report-on-Jalikattu

Summary of report: Bulls were injured not during the actual act of being tamed in the arena. They were injured in transportation to the arena (ropes through nose), in the tunnel leading to the arena (provoked and hurt to get them to go into the arena), and after the official bull-taming was over (by spectators who wanted a piece of the action and chased them around).

1. Transport to Jallikkattu venue: Bulls were brought to the venue in tempos and were tied to the sides of the tempos with ropes through their noses. Many bulls were injured just en route to the venue.

2. Health Inspection at venue: Many injured bulls were passed through inspection. 

3. Animal holding area: All bulls were grouped standing together waiting for hours to get into the arena with no rest, and little water or food.

4. Tunnel leading to arena: Bulls enter the arena using a gate called vaadi vaasal. They went to the vaasal through a narrow tunnel-like area. They could sense noise and a large crowd and didn't want to go on, but were forced to go by people lined up on both sides of the tunnel who tormented it to get it to move. People in front of it pulled it forward with fingers through the nostrils. People behind the bull inserted sticks in the bull's anus.

5. Actual bull taming: In practice only 1 in 5 bulls were even handled by the bull tamers.

6. Post bull-taming, run to open end of arena: Hundreds of spectators waited for the bull at the open end of the arena to try their own hands at taming the bulls that escaped the official tamers. Quote: The bull once has been beaten up by crowd or if it managed to escape, it would run on to the road or into the village. The very system is such that the bull has to run into the village and rampage for its life. The crowd is least interested in the arena, they seem to have come to capture the bull themselves. This is quite evident from the fact that 80-90% of the spectators are on the open end of the arena where they can attack the bull themselves.

Two articles on this subject worth reading:

http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/here-s-idea-save-jallikattu-official-whose-report-got-it-banned-56293

Choice quote from the second article: Highlighting the fact that very few participants die or are injured in jallikattu, Manoj points to statistics to show that it’s mostly spectators who are victims in the sport as they are not trained. Having the sport in a controlled atmosphere can eliminate this problem altogether.
But the animal welfare officer concludes, “It is clearly a distant dream. It won’t be acceptable to spectators as a stadium won’t satisfy them. They are there to fight bulls. People will lose in interest in jallikattu.”",,"Is Jallikkattu as practiced today, animal abuse?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5q6yxk/is_jallikkattu_as_practiced_today_animal_abuse/
1470741929.0,6,8,5,"Instead of looking within, let's look outside for a while. 

China repeatedly wins a huge number of medals in Olympics. But have you looked at the kind of sports where they gather a huge number of those medals? Synchronized Diving, Weightlifting, Badminton, Shooting, Table Tennis. Most of these are obscure sports when compared to the rest of the world. Not saying they don't do it in the common sports. But it's been a little trick in their books for a while, it seems.

China recruits elite foreign coaches for training their athletes. These cost a big amount but they do it. How many of our Indian athletes are trained by actual Olympic champions? Not many right? China also trains their athletes in foreign countries for long terms. For example, their Olympic swimmers are all trained in Australia. They have won several Golds before. 

US and China train promising kids right from their youngest possible age. It shouldn't surprise you to see a 5 year old Chinese kid dedicating all his life to be an Olympic athlete. How many of our Indian 5 year old do that? Let alone get spotted in the first instance? Don't most Indian kids swim at that age just for recreation? 

The sports culture in US and China and a lot of other Medal owning countries is huge. Kids in India are trained to be better brides or grooms but kids in these countries are spotted and trained to be better in the talent they own. It shouldn't surprise you to see a 10 year old Chinese or American kid being trained in a foreign country because their home country knows this kid is going to break records in the future. In India, if a little girl manages to cook some tea, she is adored and appreciated as a promising future bride. An Indian 5 year old kid boy who might be amazing in football but doing exceptionally well in studies would instead be pushed for his studies. Not necessarily a bad thing but he probably was much much better suited for his football skills than his studies.

For example, in Weightlifting, China has an extremely effective system of developing athletes from childhood through adulthood. They get paid a wage, they win big money from competitions. They have elite coaches at each stage of their career who are specifically suited to the needs of the athlete at that time, from instilling technical discipline as youths before lifters from most other countries have ever touched a barbell, to developing top level strength and shoring up weaknesses as seniors who've been lifting for twice as long as most other countries' lifters.

They have their education, accommodation, food, international travel etc paid for.

And then comes the infrastructure. Which includes training facilities, performance enhancing drugs, nutrition, and everything related. The Indian sports culture never took off due to the horribly imbalanced and horribly pathetic economy. With a huge population like ours, it would have been technically easier to get a bigger number of athletes but most go unheard of because of population overshadowing everything. A huge population and a world class economy would have made India the top guys in medal tally like the Olympics. 

If you side step a bit, you will see China and the US repeatedly winning Academics Olympiads too. Take a look at the medal tally for US, China and Russia in International Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy Olympiads. Hell, they have broken records there too. The Indians who do well in these International Academic Olympiads are lower in the tally but they are also the ones who get AIR in top 10 in IIT JEE or the Medical Entrances. Those kids from the US, China or Russia are exceptionally brilliant just like our Indians but they have been trained exclusively for these Olympiads for years. Indians train too but the only exclusive training we get is the regular Olympiad camp held for a month or so. 

African countries do well in athletics because of several reasons driven by the fact that they are genetically physically very fast and agile.

1472608443.0,6,61,78,"Hello Randians. I have seen, over the past few weeks, many posts on this forum asking for advice on how to eat healthy, how to become fitter and how to lead a healthier and cleaner life. As someone with an active interest in fitness and some degree of success in losing weight and keeping it off as well, I thought I would initiate a discussion to share my two cents on this, share some of my wisdom and in the process learn something from the hive mind as well. First off, I am not a fitness trainer, nor am I an expert in nutrition. I am not an athlete or someone with an extraordinary level of fitness. I have no six pack, I have no bulging muscles, I am not a gym rat and I certainly do not have the best genes in the world. I am merely someone who has successfully kept weight gain at bay, leads a physically active lifestyle and somebody who has made sure that the waist measurement of his trousers has remained the same over the past ten years (34 :D). I have been exercising and leading an active lifestyle over the last ten years and I hope to share my wisdom with you. I will structure this post to broadly address the following points.

1)	The benefits of being fit and leading a physically active lifestyle.

2)	Goals or what one must aim for.

3)	What can one do to get fit and remain fit.

4)	Diet and lifestyle.

**The benefits of being fit and leading a physically active lifestyle** – The most obvious benefit of being in shape is, of course, a longer and healthier life. Your immune system is stronger and you fall sick less often than others. You look good and you feel good. Clothes fit you better when your body is well proportioned, and you look more attractive to the opposite sex.  You are also happier because your body is producing all those endorphins that give you a natural high. If you are a man, your testosterone production too is increased, resulting in more energy, confidence and drive. Your sex drive goes through the roof and in general, you lead a better life. If not anything else, being in shape makes sure that when everything else is going wrong in your life, [you can still go to the mirror and feel good about what you see](http://tinymuscles.com/2010/you-know-you-look-at-yourself-in-the-mirror/). Finally, there is no better feeling in the world than the feeling of having exerted your muscles and earned your night’s sleep. 

**Goals or what one must aim for** – Now that we have gotten the question of why we must be fit out of the way, let us move on to what we can realistically hope to achieve. The first thing to realise is that not everybody can get a six pack, or look like [Hrithik](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/hrithik-roshan-rediscovers-athleticism-with-kris-gethin.html). In fact, six pack abs are something that is achieved through reduction in body fat percentage and not by working out obsessively. Besides, for actors and models, their body is literally their profession and some work out upwards of six hours a day. This is neither realistic not desirable for the vast majority of us. What we should aim for is to be [lean](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/23/ff/1e/23ff1e86b38067f6674d5a9484c98d5a.jpg), [physically fit](http://lh6.ggpht.com/horatiosalt/R5YjySNWb5I/AAAAAAAAAeE/luT-5gQFmbU/s800/federer+no+shirt_thumb%5B1%5D) and to be able to exert ourselves if required with the minimum of discomfort. In my opinion, the best physiques are those of fast bowlers. [Lean](http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/image/163823.html?object=40560;page=2;dir=next;), [rangy](http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/m/l/y/2/image.related.articleLeadNarrow.300x0.1mm7c.png/1319753116963.jpg) and well proportioned, some of these men will rank among the fittest of athletes. You would be surprised to know that none of them spent their lives in the gym. To fill out a T shirt or to be able to wear a slim fit shirt, and to be able to run a mile without too much discomfort is what we must aim for. 

**What can one do to get fit and remain fit** – The human body is a well-oiled machine that runs on food intake and metabolism. Metabolism, for the noobs, is the process by which food is broken down and converted to energy. Throughout our lives, the rate at which our metabolism works fluctuates. Upto the age of 22-23, the human body is growing which means that the metabolic rate is pretty high and whatever you eat will be broken down into fuel. The age of 22 is when the human body first starts slowing down, and it no longer requires as much food intake as before. This is perhaps when people first start to put on weight. A sedentary job after college, unhealthy food habits fueled by disposable income and a lack of exercise results in many people ballooning up, seemingly with no control over their own lives. It does not have to be so. After this, the next big drop in metabolic rate is at the age of 30-32.  The pressures of work, and a sedentary lifestyle at this age is the main contributor to many of the lifestyle diseases that afflict us today. Losing weight at this age is near impossible because a slowing metabolism requires a large amount of exercise to lose weight as compared to just a few years before. Again, these are merely my observations and if anyone with relevant knowledge wants to correct me, they are welcome to do so.
Any exercise program, in order to be effective, has to include the following basics. It has to include a basic series of stretches and looseners.  It has to work out muscles in the limbs such as the arms and the legs, as well as the core. And finally, it must also include a cardiovascular exercise to ensure that you get your heart rate pumping and your lungs get a good workout. It is important to have ALL of these components in your exercise regimen in order to have a complete, holistic workout. Cardio alone will not lead to weight loss beyond a point, and you will end up being skinnyfat. Similarly, working out the muscles of the upper body and the limbs alone will also be counterproductive. Thus it is necessary to have a balanced workout to maximize the benefits of your exercise program. Any exercise regimen that provides all of these basics will transform your body and put you onto the path to physical fitness. 
The exercise program that I have been following for the past ten years and that recommend strongly is the [5BX](http://www.runnersworld.com/sweat-science/the-fighter-pilot-fitness-program) program for men. Originally conceived to keep fighter pilots in the Royal Canadian Air Force fighting fit. it has now been recognised as a complete fitness program for just about anyone. It consists of five basic exercises (Hence 5BX) that incorporate all of the above in one compact twenty minute package. The first exercise is to stretch and loosen the body. The second is a series of crunches that target the abs, core and the thighs. The third is a type of plank exercise that strengths the core and the back. The fourth exercise consists of pushups, targeting the upper body and the arms. Finally, you have a cardiovascular exercise where you can either choose between a stationary run and actual running (depending on access to a running track). The exercise program has many levels from 1 to 6, with level 1 being the easiest and 6 being the toughest. The lower levels are pretty simple and you might wonder if it is effective at all, but don’t be fooled. At the higher levels, the 5BX program is a killer that will leave you gasping for breath from the exertion. And the best part? It only takes 11 minutes a day and can be done pretty much anywhere. More information is available about this program on the internet. I strongly urge you to take a look at it. This program is all you will need to become fit, stay fit and remain fit. I’ve been following this program for ten years now and it has made me fit enough to run ten kilometers under 50 minutes with virtually zero prep. I ran a half marathon in two and a half hours with only minimal training. I run a mile in six minutes and thirty seconds. I am as lean today, as I was at the age of 18. I can still wear the same pair of jeans that I wore ten years ago. What do I credit this to? The 5BX program. There is no need for expensive gym equipment and even more expensive gym memberships. I have worked out at a gym for a year and I came back to this program because I still found it better suited for my needs than the gym. The only thing to keep in mind is that physical fitness is an ultra-long term goal, and you will only achieve your goals if you stick at it.  

**Note**: The 5BX program is exclusively for men. For women, there is a complementary program called the XBX or Ten Basic Exercises that is designed exclusively for women. 

**Diet and Lifestyle** – All of the above is of no use if you do not eat healthy and take care of your body. It goes without saying that smoking is harmful. Drinking is great in moderation. Avoid drugs, even something as harmless as marijuana. Eat well, but in moderation. Personally, I have never dieted in my life. I still eat junk food like hamburgers and pizzas, only in moderation. Try to have a good, large breakfast, a moderate lunch and alight dinner. Walk as much as you can. I am lucky that I stay in a university campus and can easily get 6-8 km of walking a day. But even otherwise, make the effort to walk instead of taking a ride. You have no idea how much exercise you can get from merely incorporating 10000 steps a day into your routine. Take the stairs, play a sport, walk to the market, go dancing (for those of you with SOs), simply be physically active.  All this contributes in micro-quantities towards a healthier life. And finally, make sure you get 8 hours of sleep a day. This can make the difference between a day filled with energy and one filled with lethargy. A lot of this merely is a reiteration of the good habits that the Adarsh Balak comics mock, but they are called good habits for a reason.  So there you have it. Fitness is something that our ancestors never gave a thought about because it was incorporated into their lifestyles. Now, it is a choice that we have to make. 
If you can add anything to this post, please do so in the comments. We can all help each other out regarding questions of diet and exercise. 

**TL;DR** – Stay active and try out this thing called the 5BX plan.

Liberation of Dalits: Key to Indian Workers Revolution

Ants Among Elephants

For a Leninist Party to Fight Caste Oppression!

A Review

In modern India, with its gleaming IT centers and manufacturing hubs, there are widespread illusions that untouchability is a thing of the past. Nothing could be further from the truth. Untouchability is at the core of the caste system, which has been perpetuated and entrenched within every sphere of Indian capitalist society. Sujatha Gidla’s 2017 book, Ants Among Elephants: An Untouchable Family and the Making of Modern India, shatters many of the myths that serve to make untouchability invisible. Her book is a sharply drawn picture of caste oppression and of her family’s unending struggles against it. It is a compelling read and has been widely acclaimed by reviewers.

Untouchability is not simply a condition of poverty that can be overcome by education and social mobility. As Gidla matter-of-factly states: “I was born into a lower-middle-class family. My parents were college lecturers. I was born an untouchable.” She uses the word “untouchable” rather than “Dalit” because it emphasizes the reality of what it means to be part of that population. Untouchability was formally abolished by the constitution of India, which gained its independence from Britain in 1947, and since that time much has changed in the country. But little has changed for the vast majority of India’s 220 million Dalits, for whom freedom from the yoke of caste oppression is yet to come.

Ants Among Elephants is both a family memoir and a political history of the author’s uncle, K.G. Satyamurthy (1931-2012), who became a famous leader of a Maoist guerrilla group. As such, the book shines a harsh spotlight on the atrocious record of India’s Stalinist parties on the question of untouchability. The Communist Party of India (CPI) and its offshoot the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI[M]) reject the fight for proletarian independence, and thus the fight for socialist revolution. Instead, they subordinate the interests of the oppressed and exploited masses to an alliance with the national bourgeoisie. From its inception, the CPI has acted as an appendage of the Congress Party, which has always been permeated with brahminical (high-caste) Hindu nationalism. Both the CPI and CPI(M) have utterly refused to fight against caste oppression, falsely counterposing such a fight to the class struggle. This is the opposite of Leninism. We stand on the tradition of Bolshevik leader V.I. Lenin, who insisted that the revolutionary workers party must champion the cause of all the oppressed in society, acting as the “tribune of the people.”

Untouchability is a form of special oppression that is not simply reducible to class exploitation, though it overlaps with it. A classic example of special oppression is the subjugation of women, which is a key prop of capitalist rule; a working-class woman, for example, bears the double burden of her oppression as a woman and as a worker. India is permeated with myriad forms of oppression, including those based on religion, language, ethnicity and nationality. In heavily Muslim Kashmir, which is divided between India and Pakistan, the Indian army this month gunned down twelve people in one day.

For Marxists, addressing the oppression of Dalits is a matter of strategic importance. Without a program for the liberation of Dalits, there will be no socialist revolution in India. Dalits are a central component of the working class. To date, there is no history or tradition of genuine Leninism as applied to caste oppression. As part of the struggle to forge a genuinely Leninist party in India, we Marxists of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist) are committed to the fight to end the caste system and for the liberation of Dalits.

The Indignities of Caste Oppression

The age-old caste system is historically rooted in India’s rural village economy. The wealthy upper castes dominate the lower castes and the countless subcastes, each one bowing their heads to those above and grinding the faces of those below. But none of these caste divisions is as fundamental, or as envenomed, as the chasm between caste and outcaste. A special place in hell is reserved for “untouchables,” who are forcibly segregated, socially and often physically, beneath all castes. As Gidla writes:

“The untouchables, whose special role—whose hereditary duty—is to labor in the fields of others or to do other work that Hindu society considers filthy, are not allowed to live in the village at all. They must live outside the boundaries of the village proper. They are not allowed to enter temples. Not allowed to come near sources of drinking water used by other castes. Not allowed to eat sitting next to a caste Hindu or to use the same utensils. There are thousands of other such restrictions and indignities that vary from place to place. Every day in an Indian newspaper you can read of an untouchable beaten or killed for wearing sandals, for riding a bicycle.”

In Gujarat last year, a Dalit man was thrashed by upper-caste thugs for “sporting a moustache.” In late March, a Dalit youth was bludgeoned to death for owning and riding a horse.

Gidla’s great-grandparents, tribal forest dwellers, were born in the late 1880s. They were not Hindus but worshipped their own deities. The family was driven out of its dwellings by the British colonial rulers in order to clear the forests for teak production. Her forebears worked an unused area of land and grew crops, only to be forced to pay revenue to the hated zamindar (landowner), who collected taxes on behalf of the British. The family was driven into debt and forced to surrender its land to the zamindar, and they became landless laborers. The enslavement of tribal people (the adivasi) continues to exist to this day.

Gidla’s family converted to Christianity and Sujatha, the author, grew up in a Dalit slum in what was then part of the state of Andhra Pradesh, where being Christian is synonymous with being “untouchable.” She “knew no Christian who did not turn servile in the presence of a Hindu” and “knew no Hindu who did not look right through a Christian man standing in front of him as if he did not exist.” It was only at the age of 15 that Gidla discovered, to her great shock, that there are Christian Brahmins—the Nambudiripad caste, which exists mainly in Kerala.

So entrenched is the caste system in the Indian subcontinent that it is practiced by virtually all religious groups in the region, including Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and Buddhists. India’s Muslims are in their vast majority regarded as “untouchable” and targeted for communal violence. This month, protests of outrage erupted over the torture, rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl, Asifa, from a nomadic Muslim family—a depraved and calculated act of terror by Hindu chauvinists in Kashmir. In Bangladesh, outcastes include the Rohingya, many of whom have been massacred in Myanmar. Pakistan’s impoverished Christians, who face Muslim-chauvinist terror, including for “blasphemy,” are also overwhelmingly deemed outcastes. Oppression based on caste is rife in Nepal as well as in Sri Lanka, where it is practiced by both Tamils and Sinhalese. Gidla, who lives in New York and works as a conductor in the subway system, points out that caste prejudice is rampant among Indians living in the U.S.

Gidla’s grandparents were allowed to attend a school run by Christian missionaries. Education enabled them—and their children—to rise above the unspeakable poverty that afflicts the vast majority of Dalits. But the family could not escape the burden of their untouchability. The story of the author’s mother, Manjula, a central character in the book, gives a sense of the oppression that Dalit women face: blatant caste and sex discrimination. Manjula and the other women in the family had to clean, cook and care for the extended family. Her older brother chose Manjula’s husband, who beat her to appease his own mother. Overcoming these immense obstacles, Manjula acquired a postgraduate degree.

Gidla’s family lived in the city and was thus spared the most heinous violence that is intrinsic to the caste system in the villages. Women are particularly targeted for sadistic crimes by upper-caste men who use rape as a means to humiliate both the woman and her caste. At the same time, inter-caste relationships are deadly dangerous. In February, a 20-year-old woman writhed in agony for hours before dying of poison that her father, assisted by the mother, forced down her throat. The father told the police that this was “just punishment for loving a man outside the community,” i.e., a Dalit.

In the city, one’s caste is less obvious. But by tradition everyone has the right to know, and if you lie, countless clues would give your caste away. In the universities, Dalit students are entering citadels of brahminism. In 2016 Rohith Vemula, a Dalit student at Hyderabad Central University, was hounded to death in a witchhunt spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu-chauvinist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. Vemula’s suicide note said: “My birth is my fatal accident.” This February in Uttar Pradesh, a Dalit university student, Dileep Saroj, was beaten to death for having accidentally touched a caste Hindu. As Gidla put it: “Your life is your caste, your caste is your life.”

On average, every 15 minutes a crime is committed against Dalits, who have been facing increasing attacks since the BJP came to power in 2014. On April 2, Dalits staged an enormous bandh (shutdown protest) across India against a court ruling that weakens the Prevention of Atrocities Act, which ostensibly facilitates the prosecution of crimes committed against Dalits. Protesters were met with massive repression by the police, who killed at least twelve people, injured dozens and arrested thousands. While the legislation does little to protect Dalits from being murdered and maimed with impunity, the court ruling gives the green light to caste-chauvinist gangs for even more violent attacks. Indeed, upper-caste politicians and spokesmen have long been howling to repeal the law.

Stalinism: A Rotten Tradition on Caste

Sujatha Gidla’s uncle, K.G. Satyamurthy, who is a focus of Ants Among Elephants, was a college student when he was drawn to the Congress-led Quit India campaign against British rule. Quickly disillusioned with Congress, Satyamurthy decided to join the Communist Party of India. In so doing, he accepted the view that “one was supposed to think only in terms of class and not of caste. When the class struggle was won, discrimination based on caste would disappear.” With this rotten line, India’s Stalinist parties have tarnished the banner of communism on the question of caste, as they have on every other question of revolution. The deep caste chauvinism prevalent in society constitutes an enormous obstacle to forging the unity the working class needs in its struggles against capital. The struggle for socialist liberation in India requires the building of a Leninist vanguard party to lead the proletariat in the fight against the oppression of the Dalit masses.

Satyamurthy joined the CPI because—unusually for the Stalinists—the party joined a revolt of the oppressed in Telangana (which was then part of Andhra Pradesh). The Telangana struggle (1946-51) was an insurrection against the monstrous rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Nizam’s rule was reinforced by the British, providing a textbook example of how colonial rule strengthened the caste system. As Gidla writes: “There were systems of servitude in every part of India, but none was as ruthless as the vetti system in Telangana, the heartland of the Nizam’s kingdom of the Deccan.” Under the vetti system, “every untouchable family in the village had to give up their first male child as soon as he learned to talk and walk.” The child would become a slave in the household of the dora, the Nizam’s local agent. Similarly, all the women of the village were the property of the dora. Gidla notes that if the dora “called while they were eating they had to leave the food on their plates and come to his bed.”

The CPI in Andhra Pradesh became involved in the Telangana armed struggle and built a guerrilla army that soon controlled large areas of the countryside. In 1948, the ruling Congress Party under Jawaharlal Nehru dispatched the army to Telangana. The Nizam had initially refused to bring his kingdom into the newly independent state of India, but quickly surrendered his “princely state” to the Indian army, which then turned to its main mission: crushing the Communist-led rebellion. Over the next three years the army massacred untold numbers of Muslims, peasants and tribal people. In the wake of the slaughter, the CPI reverted back to its historic role as an appendage of Congress, which had previously ordered that Communists be hanged from trees. Gidla bitterly notes that the CPI leadership “gave in to Nehru without even demanding amnesty for the ten thousand party members who were rotting in detention camps.”

Satyamurthy was devastated that the CPI abandoned the armed struggle and even more shocked to discover that the turn was sanctioned by Stalin. In 1964, the CPI split into pro-Soviet and pro-China wings. Satyamurthy sided with the pro-China faction that would become the CPI(M), hoping that the “Chinese path” would mean following the example of Mao, who had led a peasant army to victory. But the CPI(M) voted at its first conference to follow the parliamentary road.

When the CPI(M) became part of a capitalist government in West Bengal in 1967, a layer of party cadre split and launched an armed uprising in Naxalbari, becoming known as Naxalites. The split attracted a large portion of CPI(M) members in Andhra Pradesh, including Satyamurthy and many veterans of the Telangana struggle. Both the CPI and CPI(M) drew a blood line against the Naxalites. In the 1970s, the CPI supported their ruthless suppression at the hands of Congress leader Indira Gandhi. In August 1971, CPI(M) cadre joined with Congress goons in a massacre of Naxalite suspects and sympathizers in Calcutta.

And when it came to crimes against Dalits, the CPI(M) during its decades in power in West Bengal mirrored the Indian ruling class. In 1979, the CPI(M)-led government massacred hundreds of Dalit Hindu refugees from Bangladesh who were living on the island of Marichjhapi. In 2007, in Nandigram, West Bengal, CPI(M) goons joined cops in a massacre of perhaps 100 people who were protesting against land-grabbing for capitalist enterprise.

In 1980, Satyamurthy cofounded the People’s War Group (PWG) in Andhra Pradesh with Kondapalli Seetharamayya, a caste Hindu who was a veteran of the CPI and the Telangana uprising. The PWG, which became one of the best-known Naxalite groups—and the Naxalites in general—won significant support among Dalits, for whom the armed guerrillas offered a much-needed measure of protection against the brutal violence of the upper-caste landlords and the state. However, the Maoist program offers no way forward. The Maoists have no political program other than to look for “progressive” bourgeois allies, invariably sacrificing the interests of the poorest peasants to unity with “broader forces.” According to the Naxalites, Dalits must unite with the “intermediate” castes in a struggle against the “feudal” large landowners. In reality, the “intermediate” castes are often bitterly and violently hostile to Dalits and tribal people owning land.

While the Naxalites traditionally drew their support largely from Dalits (and today mainly from among the adivasi people), they have refused to politically address the question of untouchability. The issue exploded inside the PWG in 1984 when young Dalit party members complained to Satyamurthy of caste-chauvinist practices in the functioning of the party: comrades of the barber caste were assigned to shave other comrades; those from the washer caste to wash clothes; Dalit members were told to sweep floors and clean lavatories.

Satyamurthy, who had personally experienced caste chauvinism from his comrades, scheduled a Central Committee meeting to discuss the issue. The party leadership responded by having him “expelled on the spot for ‘conspiring to divide the party’,” as Gidla reports. In refusing to even discuss caste prejudice in its own ranks, the Maoist PWG was true to its political roots in the CPI.

M.N. Roy’s Distortions of Leninism

Ants Among Elephants brilliantly exposes the political bankruptcy of Indian would-be Marxists on the question of caste oppression. The task that genuine communists face is to outline a Bolshevik perspective for India. Marxists must address the daily oppression of Dalits and adivasi people up to and after the victory of socialist revolution. The ICL looks to the lessons of the first four congresses of the Communist International (CI). We seek to forge a party in India armed with a program of permanent revolution, the program that laid the basis for victory in the Bolshevik-led 1917 October Revolution. Under the leadership of Lenin and Trotsky, the Bolsheviks established the dictatorship of the proletariat with the support of the poorer peasantry and downtrodden ethnic minorities. The Soviet government issued far-reaching decrees, granting the right of self-determination to the oppressed nations, full legal equality for women and land to landless peasants.

In 1920, Lenin drafted a set of theses on the agrarian question, which could have been written for India today. As opposed to the Maoist strategy of peasant war divorced from the struggles of the working class, the theses stipulate that “there is no salvation for the working masses of the countryside except in alliance with the Communist proletariat.” The theses continued: “The industrial workers cannot accomplish their epoch-making mission of emancipating mankind from the yoke of capital and from wars if they confine themselves to their narrow craft, or trade interests, and smugly restrict themselves to attaining an improvement in their own conditions.”

The founder of the Communist Party in India, M.N. Roy, brought a distortion of Leninism to the subcontinent and put the nascent movement on a course of capitulation to bourgeois nationalism. As early as 1922, Roy drafted a manifesto for the bourgeois-nationalist Congress Party urging the organization to put itself at the head of the working-class and peasant masses. Under Roy’s guidance, the CPI set out from its founding in December 1925 to build a Peasants’ and Workers’ Party in Bengal. Rather than fighting to build a proletarian party that could lead the peasant masses, Roy sought to build a two-class party (i.e., a bourgeois party) where the interests of the working class would necessarily be subordinated to those of the petty-bourgeois peasantry.

Roy’s political program was contrary to the perspective outlined at the 1920 Second Congress of the CI, which Roy himself attended. Lenin insisted: “The Communist International must enter into a temporary alliance with bourgeois democracy in the colonial and backward countries, but should not merge with it, and should under all circumstances uphold the independence of the proletarian movement even if it is in its most embryonic form” (“Preliminary Draft Theses on the National and the Colonial Questions,” 1920).

When the CI came under the bureaucratic leadership of the nationalist Stalinist bureaucracy, Roy acted as Stalin’s representative in China in 1927. On Stalin’s instructions, the Chinese Communist Party remained within the bourgeois-nationalist Guomindang even as its leader, Chiang Kai-shek, staged a coup in April 1927 and disarmed and massacred tens of thousands of Communist-led workers in Shanghai (see “M.N. Roy, Nationalist Menshevik,” Spartacist [English-language edition] No. 62, Spring 2011). The slaughter in China was the bitter fruit of the Stalinist program of subordinating the proletariat to the bourgeois nationalists. Two decades later, the Indian Stalinists reaped the reward for their support to the Indian nationalists in the bloody suppression of the Communist-led peasant uprising in Telangana at the hands of Nehru and his home minister, Vallabhbhai Patel, known as the “Iron Man of India.”

The CPI’s capitulation to brahminical chauvinism precluded their fighting against the oppression of Dalits. This was evident in the late 1920s when Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the historic Dalit leader, led mass protests against untouchability in the state of Maharashtra. During that period, the Communists had acquired significant support among the combative proletariat in the Bombay textile mills, where Dalit workers were forbidden from working in the higher-paying weaving department and forced to drink water from separate pitchers. A Leninist party would have fought tooth and nail to win all workers to demand an end to untouchability in the workplace and for equal pay for all.

But CPI leaders would not carry out such a fight and did not even mobilize for the protests against untouchability. An exasperated Ambedkar disdained the CPI leaders as “mostly a bunch of Brahmin boys.” He concluded: “The Russians made a great mistake to entrust the Communist movement in India to them. Either the Russians didn’t want Communism in India—they wanted only drummer boys—or they didn’t understand” (quoted in Selig S. Harrison, India: The Most Dangerous Decades [1960]).

Amid the growing drive for Indian independence from British rule, the CPI grotesquely dismissed the fight against caste oppression as a diversion from the “anti-imperialist” struggle. Moreover, in the wretched tradition of Roy, the CPI ceded the leadership of the anti-colonial struggle to the bourgeois nationalists led by Mohandas (“Mahatma”) Gandhi. By turning a deaf ear to the struggle against untouchability, the CPI drove many Dalits into Ambedkar’s dead-end framework of reforming capitalism.

In 1931, the British masters of “divide and rule” offered Ambedkar a separate electorate for the “depressed classes,” as they had granted to Muslims. This would have allowed Dalits, who are geographically dispersed, to form a single electoral bloc. Astutely recognizing that Ambedkar’s followers might unite with Muslims to form a counterweight to Congress, Gandhi declared a “fast to the death” against the British proposal. In opposition to Ambedkar, Gandhi proclaimed himself to be the leader of those he patronizingly labeled “harijans” (children of God). Though he campaigned against certain aspects of untouchability—demanding, for example, temple entry—Gandhi was a staunch supporter of the brahminical caste system.

For his part, Ambedkar fostered illusions that the British could be used as a bulwark against the upper-caste Indian nationalists. With the outbreak of World War II, he supported the imperialists and joined the Viceroy’s Executive Council. In this, he was not unique. Gandhi, too, supported the British at the beginning of the war, though he could not win the Congress leadership to his position. It was not until 1942 that Congress launched the Quit India movement. As for the CPI, the Indian Stalinists also supported the “democratic” imperialists from the time of Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 onward, betraying the interests of the colonial masses.

Following independence, the ruling Congress Party agreed to reserve seats in Parliament for “scheduled” tribes and castes and co-opted Ambedkar to draft the new constitution. In addition to banning untouchability, the written document promised many freedoms, including for women, but they remained largely a dead letter. Ambedkar himself later noted: “The same old tyranny, the same old oppression, the same old discrimination which existed before, exists now, and perhaps in a worse form.”

For a Trotskyist Perspective

India’s transition from preindustrial society did not lead to the dissolution of caste relations. The British colonial rulers—backed by the large landowners and nascent local bourgeoisie—preserved, manipulated and reinforced rural backwardness and the caste system. The post-independence period has shown that the Indian capitalist rulers are incapable of solving basic democratic questions. The land reforms introduced by Congress largely restricted redistribution to those within the landowning castes.

To this day, Dalits who manage to buy land are often attacked by mobs, and the legal transfer of ownership is routinely bogged down in wrangles for years. The proportion of landless people in rural India has increased from 28 percent of the rural population in 1951 to nearly 55 percent in 2011. And it continues to rise.

Indian capital is dependent on imperialist finance capital. Almost 70 percent of the population lives in small villages. However, the rural areas are no longer the main source of capital accumulation for the dominant rural castes, who are increasingly investing in industry. This fact underlines that the fight to expropriate the landlords—and provide land to the landless masses—is inseparable from the fight to expropriate the bourgeoisie as a class.

Side by side with its rural backwardness, India is now the fifth-largest manufacturer in the world. The Indian proletariat is small relative to the rural population, but it has the social power to lead the peasant masses and all the oppressed in a fight to overthrow capitalist exploitation. To exercise that power will take a struggle to overcome the insidious caste divisions in the working class.

As Leninists, the ICL fights to build a vanguard party that imbues the proletariat with the understanding that the struggle against Dalit oppression is in the interest of the entire working class of India. A case in point would be to mobilize to free 13 imprisoned union leaders from the Maruti Suzuki plant at Gurgaon-Manesar near Delhi. In 2012, a supervisor attacked a Dalit worker with casteist slurs. The union defended the worker. But the company, which has long sought to crush the union, hired thugs who provoked an altercation, after which the union leaders were outrageously framed up on a murder charge. Last year, the 13 unionists were sentenced to life in prison (see “India: Free Maruti Suzuki Union Leaders!” WV No. 1112, 19 May 2017).

The workers movement should also take a stand in defense of the Bhim Army, a Dalit rights organization that has been subjected to fierce repression by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. The Bhim Army’s leader, Chandrashekhar Azad, is being held in prison under the draconian National Security Act, despite having been acquitted of all the (bogus) charges against him. The unions and organizations of the oppressed must demand: Free Chandrashekhar Azad now!

Sujatha Gidla’s Ants Among Elephants powerfully illustrates the central role caste oppression plays in Indian society. The liberation of the Dalit masses requires the forging of a revolutionary workers party dedicated to fighting all forms of oppression. In turn, Marxists committed to building such a party must fight to overcome the shameful legacy of Stalinism by planting the banner of the Trotskyist program of permanent revolution. This program is thoroughly internationalist, aiming for proletarian revolution not only in India and the rest of South Asia but also in the imperialist centers of North America, West Europe and Japan. The true Leninist party that we aim to build will be composed in its majority of Dalits as well as oppressed minorities. Winning the trust of the Dalits and adivasi people will require special demands and forms of organization. A Leninist-Trotskyist party in India, section of a reforged Fourth International, will open up the possibility of a way out of the endless cycles of brutal oppression, injustice and poverty.

1461362094.0,6,33,44,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

Edit: I am eventually going to get hotstar and netflix subscription, in terms of cost for a single tv it used to cost me Rs.300 a month for all SD channels, now its basically my jio connection and wifi (which i was gonna be paying for anyway so i wont include them) other than this, even if i get subscriptions it'll cost me Rs.1500/year for hotstar+prime with which i get music, movies and books from prime, also alexa smart home as i have a couple of smart bulbs. You might aswell include the price of my Jio Sim which is about Rs.1800/year, i would still save Rs.200 yearly. Pretty much everything is sorted except Netflix which i was thinking of getting but they are cancelling all the marvel shows and costs a lot, still not putting money into their pockets, i may share an account though.

1461362094.0,10,33,46,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3mx2b5/next_door_to_delhi_mob_kills_50yearold_injures/

Not ranting specifically about the downvotes here, but it would be nice if people understood that following Reddiquette is essential to maintain the standards of discussions on reddit. Reproducing a part of Reddiquette here specific to voting:

>Vote. If you think **something contributes to conversation**, upvote it. If you think it **does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted** in or is **off-topic** in a particular community, downvote it.

>Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and **examine your reasons for downvoting**, rather than doing so **out of an emotional reaction**, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

Few observations that I want to highlight:

1) People are always going to have a different opinion from that of yours. And this forum should be used to understand that differing opinion and the thought-process behind it. After all, we are trying to learn from each other here. If you still don't agree with that opinion just move on. No one is on a mission here to brainwash people into agreeing to something over here.

2) We are all educated folks here. We know that every human being is complicated and he cannot be labelled and put into neat square boxes. Still,we always want it to be either 'this' or 'that'? If someone is opposing BJP, it makes him a AAP loyalist. If someone is criticising the government it makes him an anti-nationalist. If someone is finding fault with a road project through Western Ghats, it makes him a Maoist.

3) If you don't understand something, ask for more explanation. Don't assume things, vote and then carry that incomplete knowledge elsewhere. Ignorance spreads like wild fire and what you mention here might actually end up in someone's serious coffee-table discussions. Always, support your comments with sources when possible. Also, keep in mind just because a comment has lots of sources, doesn't necessarily mean that opinion is unbiased.

4) Jokes and funny comments - Make them all you want and share the lulz but don't use them to attack someone because his opinion is different from that of the crowd. Doesn't really serve the purpose. You wouldn't do that if you are having a serious discussion with your friends, would you?

5) Generalising and stereotyping - Makes your argument weak if you indulge generalizations and stereotyping (Hindus are blah blah, Modi always does blah blah). We have an issue with /r/worldnews having bad stereotypes about us. Have we checked our own sub before pointing fingers at others?

6) Put yourself in the other guy's shoes - I see a lot of comments criticising people without actually trying to understand their PoV. Why they do/say whatever they did/said? What were the circumstances? Would you have reacted differently if you had been in their place?

There are users, I know of, on this sub who gets downvoted on almost every thread because they generally make unpopular comments which differ from the common opinion (not troll comments, genuinely good sensible comments). The same users get upvoted like crazy if they make a lulzworthy comment. Kind of shows you that there is something seriously broken with how this sub functions sometimes. 

I know this post would probably be downvoted but I wanted to post it nonetheless. I learn a lot from this site and it is still one of the best sources of lulz and learning for me on the internet.

1331069367.0,10,114,63,"*This is regarding the act of up-voting and down-voting on this subreddit.* 

Before I start, here's a link to [Rediquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). I sincerely hope all of you, at some point, have gone through it. 

Now I understand how making a post regarding the voting could seem against one of the tenets of Rediquette, but I must, at this point, emphasize that I'm saying this with concern that a community, I feel attached to, is/could be discouraging other users, existing or prospective.

Now, it is a simple observation and I'm sure most of you would agree with me when I say, for reasons unbeknownst, most comments and posts here attract lots of downvotes. With due regard to the vote-fuzzing explained by the admins, in comparison to other subreddits, I can only observe there is heavier downvoting here. At this point, if the mods or users have an alternative plausible explanation to the phenomenon, the rest of the post could be deemed pointless. 

By rediquette, which I hope is something we agree upon, the only reasons why anyone should downvote is if you find that the content to be irrelevant to the topic or against community guidelines such as posting personal information, abusive content etc. It is suggested against downvoting someone just because you disagree with them or if they are critical of your views. It's also an encouraged practice to state why you downvote someone so it acts as constructive criticism. 

Coming to the noticeable practices in r/India, 

* users attract downvotes because they present alternative views in thread which are predominantly about one topic and not inviting discourse or diatribe.
* some users attract downvotes because they have at some point, divulged their personal information like religious beliefs, regions etc and they choose to comment with a counter-view. This info. is pointed out relentlessly under the said comment and turned into an ad-hominem attack. 
* some users attract downvotes because of their handles although it might have nothing to do with the content in their comments.  
* some users have repeatedly been mass-downvoted because they are considered trolls by a lot of other users. At this point, I'd just like to point out that viewing a comment unto itself is understandably better than holding a cumulative of their opinions every time you vote. If a said 'religious troll' is making a comment about auto-rickshaws in a city, he/she is still heavily downvoted.
* grammar, quality of comment etc also attract downvotes. Please bear in mind that not all users may be very comfortable with English. 

Karma means nothing and its hardly indicative of users' seriousness here. However, while downvotes needn't be paid any heed, they can discourage serious users who don't quite mind contributing to the discussions here. As someone who has been a regular here for over two years, it's disheartening to see so many well-meaning members leave and/or repeatedly feel discouraged. 

It's only a sincere request to the various members and trolls here to give others a chance, be open to ideas and more importantly, stop discouraging other users through blatant and oftentimes abusive criticism or the quintessential downvote. 

This isn't and needn't be a serious concern to me or most people here but it's a practice that doesn't take much to follow and could only be viewed, imho, as a constructive step.

P.S. [Obligatory Indian cat picture](http://i.imgur.com/INzoO.jpg)

**EDIT:** Far from surprise, this post also has started receiving its share of downvotes. 

But more importantly, I'd like to add a point on trolling. There are some obvious troll accounts who comment on most threads. The whole exercise of trolling is to be seek negative attention. Kindly refrain from downvoting Or upvoting the said troll accounts. You're only fueling the act and that's not desirable. Please ignore and carry on.

1407872937.0,10,107,162,"The Indian victory against Pakistan in 1971 was one of the greatest examples of operational art and the largest combined arms operation after World War 2. It was a masterpiece of Political objective, Strategic vision, operational planning and tactical execution.


It is important to understand why it was seen as such a great victory. Warfare is usually divided into Positional attrition warfare (think World War 1, Iran-Iraq war or even the India-China war / India-Pakistan war of 1965) or maneuver driven situational warfare. The concept of maneuver warfare was propounded (at around the same time) by various European warfare experts, B.H.Liddel Hart (England) and Mikail Tucahavesky (shot dead by Stalin, and one of THE finest military minds the world has ever seen) was it’s greatest exponent. His theory was, 


Attack on a broad front > use air superiority and arty to make holes in the enemy line > Use this penetration to feed in highly mobile troops who would use maneuver to keep the enemy off balance. The Positional warfare suggests that you can win a war only by crushing the enemies main point of defense (mostly frontally – the British were a firm believer in this theory) while indirect / maneuver warfare suggests that you avoid the strong points, and hit the vulnerable rear of the enemy, keep him off balance, deny him his CCI structure and win the war by using terrain and encirclement (read up on Cannae or Kharkov / Smolensk for examples of encirclement warfare) .


India which had favoured the first theory in all it’s wars till then used the second theory to great effect.


**The Planning:**


In March 1971, Indira Gandhi came back to power with a resounding mandate, and was faced with an immediate crisis! The Bangladeshi refugee problem. A genocide in East Pakistan (estimated deaths vary from 3 million to 4 million) was pushing a massive amount of refugees into India. Her cabinet (especially Defence minister Jagjivan Ram) favoured immediate invasion to settle this crisis and to discuss this, she summoned the CoAS – Sam ‘Bahadur’ Manekshaw. In a very interesting and stormy meeting, she told him to prepare for an invasion of East Pakistan.  Sam Bahadur point blank refused to entertain this and offered to resign straight away. Indira who was used to getting her way, did not like this resistance but asked her advisors to leave the room and had Manekshaw speak his mind freely. He laid down three reasons why he preferred an invasion in the closing months of the year. In this he was going against both Jagjivan Ram and Indira Gandhi  and he was aware of this, but he refused to be a party to a botched up invasion.


•	The Passes with China would be closed because of snow, making it difficult for the Chinese to intervene. In June (when Indira was asking him to invade) the passes would be clear and would need a diversion of efforts to defend these.

•	Monsoon (in this he was proven very right) and the resulting quagmire. The Russian word for it was called “Raptistuta” and means a sea of mud! Mud is the worst enemy for movement (even hard snow can be managed) as it stalls movement to a very low speed. Monsoon would also mean rivers would be in spate so bridging & fording them would be eminently more challenging. August that year saw the worst tropical storm on record till date. It inundated whole parts of Bangladesh and killed half a million Bangladeshi’s.

•	The last was building up a strong and valid cassus belli (cause for war). If India was seen as the aggressor, sanctions would cripple an already crippled economy. It needed to make a case for itself. In the mean time it could use the Bangladeshi govt in exile (based in Calcutta) and the newly created Mutki Bahini to drum up support for itself.

Indira Gandhi agreed to his conditions and set about on a whirlwind tour of diplomacy. She went to Moscow, US, UK & France. She told the governments there that the situation was untenable, but Pakistan was a strong member of the SEATO and CENTO so the western democracies (in a blatant case of hypocrisy) stood by idly while a massive genocide was being perpetrated. Only the USSR recognized the problem, and shipped arms & ammunitions to India to build up her stockpile. India also signed a 20 year treaty of friendship and mutual assistance (this was to prevent any actions by the NATO / US / China)


Mankeshaw then went to work. He created a JIC (IB+RAW+Military intelligence) and a Joint Planning Command (India did not and still does not have a Combined Chief of Staffs like other nations do) to bring the civilians, army, navy and airforce together in the planning. Overall command was given to Lt Gen J.S.Arora who was CiC of the Eastern Command.


**Order Of Battle**


The OOB was as follows, Eastern Command > 3 Army Corps (2nd, 33rd and 4th) > 5 Infantry divisions + 2 Mountain that were on defensive mode. Attached to the infantry divs we had the equivalent of 1 armored division (broken up into regiments). 
Pakistan had roughly 3 Infantry divs and 2 divisions worth of paramilitary and a brigade of armour.


The odds were roughly 2:1 favouring India (conventionally 4:1 was recommended, 3:1 was the bare minimum). In the air India had total supremacy in the east(which was vital) and marginal superiority in the west.


The Mukti Bahini had roughly 60,000 numbers of irregulars. They played the exact same role the French partisans played in WW2 after Normandy. During the war, the Mukti Bahini contributed to the speed of advance of the Indians by providing ready labor and intelligence on the deployment of Pakistani forces. The MB sabotaged Pakistani lines of communication, they struck at weak points (in the rear) with brigade sized forces and caused the Pakistani defence to spread itself thin.


**The Indian Plan**

It was multi layered in it’s approach. Attack in depth to force the Pakistanis to thin themselves out, Cutoff river crossings (to prevent reinforcements and retreat from reaching the Pakistani troops) and finally capture the two key ports in Bangladesh. 

There was one major element of genius provided by J.S.Arora. He changed the Schwerpunkt from the logical south to the more difficult east. The South had it’s base in Bengal, had access to major railway lines and depots and Lt Gen Niazi (Pakistani commander) anticipated the main focus (Schwerpunkt) to be in this sector and aligned his defences accordingly. The East had everything going against it. The main base was inn Tripura, supply / logistics chains had immense difficulties but it was also the closest route to Dhaka. 

J.S Arora allocated the strongest force to the East and the weakest force to the South (the exact opposite of the Pakistani defensive alignment). This has it’s roots in classical warfare including WW2 and the battle of Cannae (which was positional warfare for it’s time). Operation Barbarossa focused it’s Schwerpunkt in the Centre and North while Stavka (Soviet high command aka Stalin) anticipated the key thrust in the South. The German approach to indirect warfare surprised the Russians and caused them a massive loss in men, space and equipment.


**The Pakistani Plan**

Counter offensive in the West and a tiered defense in the East using river lines and cities as strong points (very similar in concept to the Russian defense in WW2 – use river lines and force attritional warfare on the invader. Retreat to city holdfasts and engage troops in urban warfare. Hold out and delay the offensive till such time the UN forced a cease fire (like it had done in the Israeli wars). 

In Bangladesh, Niazi proposed retreating to just outside Dhaka and holding a region around Dhaka (using river lines and Dhaka as a central pivot). The Pakistani establishment rejected this. Once again we have parallels in World War 2. Poland had the option to withdraw it’s forces to the Vistula line, use Warsaw as a pivot and defend a limited area, both these sound ideas were rejected because…”Nationalism”! Not one inch of land would be surrendered etc etc. Niazi went for (as the Indian side had hoped) the WW2 Russian strategy of defending some fortified towns (or as Hitler called them – Festungs) and river lines (bridges). 

The idea was to cut down on the Indian freedom of movement by forcing them to engage in urban warfare. They did make a fatal flaw in their planning. They assumed that India would fight 10 different “Stalingrads”, and never reach Dhaka so they never allocated troops to defend Dhaka (the same mistake Hitler made in WW2 with respect to the defence of Berlin)


**The War**

•	3rd December, Operation Chingis goes in. Pakistan launches a preemptive strike on Indian airfields (in the West). The IAF fights a holding campaign before launching a massive bombardment operation the next morning. In the East, elements of 33 Corps go into action, their objective is to take a vital railway junction. Hilli however was one of the first echelons of Pakistan’s defenses and was very well prepared and supplied. The battle quickly became a battle of attritional warfare, however 340 Brigade spotted an opening in the flank and in a very German Blitzkrieg type of operation, formed combat groups (on the spot) of tanks and infantry and exploited the gap, and these combat groups raced to the river lines that Pakistan had intended to use as defensive strongpoints. Faced with Indians in the rear and forward of them, the resistance quickly collapsed.


•	In the South, using maneuver warfare (as against to positional warfare used by 33 Corp) 2 Corps makes rapid progress, 2 Corps launches a pincer attack using two infantry divisions to envelop Pakistani defences. They keep pushing on towards their target without giving the defenders time to rest and redraw their defensive lines. 2 Corps used the classic maneuver tactics used by Germany in WW2, Israel in the Sinai. They ignored strong points while rushing the rear of the enemy lines (the OMG of Russian doctrine came into play). The infantry pushed on into Pakistani frontline positions who attempted to withdraw to prepared lines only to find them occupied by Indian troops. Defense spectacularly collapsed in this sector. 

•	In the East, 4 Corps (the largest Indian grouping with 3 divisions) and a bold leader pretty much repeated what 2 Corps did. The CO (Lt Gen Sagat Singh) used the Russian concept of Maskirovka and set up a feint attack towards Chittagong, this drew Pakistani defenders (already facing 3:1 odds) to Chittagong weakening their centre. Here we come across a massive feat of arms – Airlifting of 2 entire combat equipped brigades. Rather than contest the Meghna river bridges, Singh sidestepped the exceedingly strong Pakistani defences by getting 2 brigades airlifted and dropped across the river (right into Pakistani lines). The eastern sector was decided as the Schwerpunkt (the focus point of the offensive) and it showed. The Indian troops rapidly outflanked prepared Pakistani positions, artillery was used to bombard these pockets into submission, the IAF flew CAS (Combat Air Support) / Interdiction missions all of which freed the infantry and armour to keep moving. This was classic Blitzkrieg minus only the Stuka sirens. 


The Pakistani forces were in headlong retreat towards Dhaka and this posed a big problem. If they gained the Dhaka region, they could organize a very stubborn defense which would cost 1000’s of Indian lives to capture. To prevent this, 2 Para was dropped BEHIND enemy lines into the region of Tangail. They were very less in number, and if the Pakistanis had grouped up and attempted to fight their way through, 4 Para could have been decimated, but thanks to the Indian Blitzkrieg tactic, the Pakistani C&C set up was decimated and they could not mount a cohesive response. After the drop, the demoralization (and destruction) of organized resistance was complete.


**Psycops**


The Pakistani resistance still numbered in the 1,00,000 and pockets could take a lot of Indian lives to break, so India went on a pysop campaign. Pakistani wirless networks were spammed with “surrender and live” messages (India had cracked the cipher used in East Pakistan before the war itself), Sam Bahadur himself went on air and told Pakistanis that if they surrendered they would be treated honourably, and this cracked any vestige of resistance. Pakistani soldiers began surrendering to the Indian army in droves. Niazi signed the instrument of surrender (a bitter man) on 16th December and went into captivity, along with him 91,000 Pakistani troops also went into captivity.

1386730182.0,10,12,4,"So i found out a while back that there is an idea in the works to erect a statue of Sardar Patel that will put the country back by ~200 crore. 

Now, I think this is a horrible and hollow idea. Political posturing at it's worst. What is the logic behind pouring such a large sum of money into a project like this when there are millions of people who are actually alive that the money would serve better? 

A large portion of the population goes hungry and cold every night. Why spend such a vast sum 'honoring' a dead man who probably wouldn't approve of this himself if he were alive to see it? Wouldn't empowering the poor and the destitute of our country be a better use for the money? 

I do not want this harebrained idea to see the light of day and I doubt that I am alone in this. What can we do to make our voices heard? What can we do to ensure that reason prevails in this matter? 

I understand that it will help tourism, but is that really worth the cost of letting the poorest among us go hungry? 

I speak as a layman who is quite out of the loop as far as politics is concerned so if there is an aspect of this that I am not considering, please, let me know.

We are limiting ourselves to publicly available short stories by Indian authors. Our first story was '[Delhi' by Vandana Singh](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpnh70/reading_group_1_delhi_by_vandana_singh_sff/). This week, the story is:

> This story was first published in 1926 in a Hindi magazine called Madhuri, and if you have Premchand's Collected Works in Hindi, you will find this story in vol 5 of 
> Mansarovar. This English translation is by Fatima Rizvi, and was published in Out of Print Magazine, and was a runner up for the Jawed Memorial translation prize.
> A Hindi audio narration by Jameel Gulrayys is available on Youtube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=902y-a1VIZg).

For those who aren't familiar, Dhanpat Rai Shrivastava, who wrote under the pen-name of [Munshi Premchand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premchand), was a prolific - and popular - writer of short stories in Hindi, in the early 1900s. 

This story is interesting for many reasons - 'Qazzaqi' means outlaw, although in the story, the qazzaqi in question is a mail-carrier. Premchand's acute understanding of poverty and class is very apparent from this story of the friendship between a the qazzaqi and a young child. 

The rules are simple - read the story and tell us what you thought about it in the comments.

1361024865.0,10,157,219,"Hi /r/india! 

The most common complaints about /r/india arise because of it's culture. Downvoting, abuses and hostility towards differing opinions are very common. We've all had our days when we recoil, aghast, from the cesspool of comments on a particular thread.

Nevertheless, the cloud has a silver lining. Older users will agree that things have improved significantly since the days of the multiple -ki-baap, -ki-maa, and _spokesperson accounts. How can we nurture and sustain this delicate green shoot of civil discussion? Here are some guidelines, adapted from [reddit's ettiquette guide.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

###1. The downvote is not a ""dislike"" button
Please do not downvote a post or a comment only because you think it's wrong, or you're not interested in it. 

Downvote **posts** if you think these kinds of posts do not belong on /r/india, or if you've seen the same content being posted multiple times before. Multiple posts of a single breaking news events, million photographs of ""farmers"", and links to FB flamewars are good examples of posts which I would downvote. 

Downvote **comments** if you think it is harmful to the discussion. Rude attacks on other users, paranoid conspiracy theories, and _some_ trolls are examples of comments I would downvote. I don't like Modi, but many times I have upvoted comments which support him because many people have different opinions, and I respect that. 

###2. Redditors are real people too!
This is an anonymous internet forum, and it's easy to temporarily forget that the user you're speaking to is a real person, with family and a life and her own problems, likes and dislikes. So before you call someone an idiot, retard, chaddi, Congie, etc., please think: would you do this to a real person in your life? What makes you think it's okay to do that to people on reddit? 

###3. /r/india is mainly what users make it
A subreddit is mainly determined by what its users do. If you want more self posts, submit more, and upvote them when you see them. If you want less politics, ~~downvote~~ IGNORE politics posts, and submit and upvote more non-political content.     
If you are not okay with insults and rudeness, then leave a _polite_ reminder asking people to be more civil. Downvote only the worst comments.

----

tl;dr: The next time you feel an urge to downvote someone politely saying something about Modi, Sachin, rape, SRK, or how your hometown sucks, please DON'T. Even worse, don't insult them for their opinion. _Explain_ why you disagree, instead.  
Don't _only_ complain about content, please contribute content you would like to see. ",,Do your bit to make /r/india a friendlier place! (Please upvote for visibility),https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/18mkwq/do_your_bit_to_make_rindia_a_friendlier_place/

So, i have seen confusions around this topic, so i will divide it into two parts. First will be the part that has no confusions.  
And in the second, i will try to answer confusions with my own interpretations and understandings which come from 7+ years of studying the puranas and 'living' the life of meditation (some questions are welcome):  
  
Non-Confusion Knowledge:  
--------------------------------------------  
  
1) The Lord Brahma comes into being at the start, lives for 100 of his years, each has 360 days, each daytime = kalpa and has 1000 chaturyugas, followed by an equal length of the night.  
  
2) Pretty much soon after coming into existence, The Lord of Creation starts to create the universe. So the lifetime of his is the same as age of universe 'till it will end'.  
So to calculate the complete age and not age as of today, we have:  
100 x 360 x 1000 x 2 kalpas. The two at the end corresponds to nighttime.  
The length of a kalpa I will cover in my interpretation.  
  
3) We are midway somewhere. To be exact:  
51st year of brahma  
Xth day of brahma (my interpretation later)  
7th manvantara  
28th chaturyuga  
Exact current yuga detail in my interpretation below.  
  
Confusion Part (and my interpretations):  
-----------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**1) Length of a chaturyuga in human years.**  
This I have inferred to be 24000 human years. The interpretation of some was 24000 celestial years which would mean 24,000 x 360=8,640,000 years. But this has recently been pointed out to be a wrong interpretation attributed to the effect of kaliyuga on the mind.  
Thus going by this, the final age of universe would be about 100 x 360 x 1000 x 2 x 24000 = 1,728,000,000,000 years or 1 trillion and 728 billion years. Of course, it is reasonable to agree that The Lord Brahma would have taken the equivalent of some human years before he actually began with his retinue and will end it not at the 12th hour.  
  
**2) Exact day of the 51st year of the Lord Brahma.**  
This I have interpreted to be 54th day.  
  
**3) Exact time in the current chaturyuga.**  
Again, as has been recently pointed, we are in the ascending dwapara of the 28th chaturyuga. And the Kaliyuga ended in the year 1699.  
These can be googled.  
  
Thus going by these, my personal interpretation of the 'current' age of the Universe is:  
a) For 50 years:  
50×360×1,000×2×24,000 = 864,000,000,000 years.  
  
b) For 53 past days:
53 x 2  x 1000 x 24000 =  2,544,000,000 years
  
c) For the current day:  
We are in the 7th manvantara (each has 71 chaturyugas + .5 in between manvantaras) and 28th of its chaturyuga, so  
6 x 71 + 3 + 27 = 456 chaturyugas gone, so:  
456 x 24000 =10,944,000 years
  
d) For the current chaturyuga:  
Since last kaliyuga ended in 1699, so since then we have had 2014 - 1699 = 315 years. Adding 12000 years for the descent, we have,  
12000 + 315 = 12315 till 31st december 2014.  
  
So, the final tally for the current age of the universe would be (adding the above a, b, c d calculations):  
 864,000,000,000 + 2,544,000,000 + 10,944,000 + 12315 = 866,554,956,315 years.  
  
**That is, the Current Age of the Universe is 866 billion, 554 million, 956 thousand and 315 years as of 31st december 2014.**
  
For the Final Age of the Universe we have:  
100 × 360 × 1000 × 2 × 24000 = 1,728,000,000,000 years.  
This is how long the material universe tends to last.  
  
Now, you are welcome to share your interpretations.   
  
Ok, I will add this reddit thing :  
**TLDR : My interpretation of the Current Age of the Universe is 866 billion, 554 million, 956 thousand and 315 years as of 31st december 2014**  
  
And this Hindu thing:  
**By the grace of the Lords and the blessings of Mothers, I release this knowledge to the world.**  
  
Edit : This blind downvoting is the sign of intolerance. Those who think they have understood too much of science, I would like to point it to them that the civilization of the west is a civilization of light. Go spread some light if you identify so much with it. Why do you get so insecure when other viewpoints are put up? Even interpretations? If you want to have your own space, dont call it india. A separate sub can always be had.

1407248975.0,10,420,233,"Hi /r/India,  
Standing close to the 26,000 subscriber mark, today we kind of have a bitter-sweet moment here on /r/India. Most of you must be aware of the blatant hate-mongering, religious intolerance and rumors being spread on our subreddit, riding safely under the pretext: Freedom of Speech. Any action taken by us to regulate this, is met with an army of hateful comments, downvotes and outcries of censorship. 

This propaganda is in no way the combined sentiment of /r/india and is basically the work of a few dedicated individuals using this subreddit as their personal weapon. With their strong language, and hateful comments, these radicals have kind of succeeded in discouraging people with opposing views to even bother participating and questioning their false, bigoted propaganda. 

We let this go on for quite a while now, hoping the community will self-moderate and drown these seemingly hate-filled radicals with their voice and votes, but after seeing comments openly asking for genocide of certain religious sects (you know which) getting upvoted to the top, we have decided to put an end to this ourselves.

Following are a couple of new rules and re-iterations on existing ones:

1. **Unverified Flair**: Posts making claims without any credible source are liable to get flaired as Unverified by the mods. This flair will be removed swiftly if OP or any other user provides substantial proof  for their claims. NOTE: Facebook updates and/or tweets by unverified parties do not count as *credible source*.

2. **Moderated Flair**: Starting today, *all religious posts* are *liable* to be marked as **Moderated** by the mods. Off late, we have seen discussions going from *Manusmriti to cow-urine, riots to burning people alive.* Moderated posts will be actively monitored for hate speech and off-topic comments inciting hatred and bigotry. This flair can *also* be applied to non-religious post which are controversial by their nature, based on our discretion, to keep the discussion civil and on-topic. Moderated is similar to the [\[R\]eddiquette flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/reddiquette) and all the rules that come with it.  As a suggestion, please remember, /r/india is a subreddit about India, Indians and matters that directly related to India. Please use theology subreddits for generic discussions on religions.

 Before the questions about censorship come up, let us clear things up (to the best of our abilities) as to what the Moderated flair will ensure (just one from million examples):  
 * We will NOT remove your opinions on how Kejriwal is a drama queen, playing appeasement politics, or why Modi doesn’t care about Muslims (provided it is relevant to discussion at hand)
 * But if your opinion is how all muslims need to be deported to Pakistan and Hindus need to drown in cow piss, I’m sorry we really don’t need your brilliant opinion in moderated threads.  
 * *+1 to OP*: No thanks, we have votes for this. Take your love for OP to PMs  
 * *OP is just wearing saffron glasses / OP is secular*: Stop! we are better off without your insight. 

 There are infinite such examples which cannot possibly be covered, but this should give you a basic idea.

3. **Self Posts:** /r/india is a social media platform to share links, and for thoughtful discussion. This is not twitter or facebook to share biased and unsubstantiated opinions. This is not your soapbox to vent in the title and leave an empty post behind for people to squabble about. All self posts that have no OC in the body will be removed. Context is important. Self posts with incendiary titles will be removed.

4. **Banning of users:** We issue warnings to users as a courtesy, and to give them a chance to realign with the rules on /r/india. As such, banning people is solely a moderator’s discretion. The nature of the ban (temp ban or otherwise, number of warnings) depends on the user’s history and the kind of comment(s) in question. Hate speech, users with singular agenda will be banned instantly with no warnings.

5. **Use Reddiquette Flair:**  If you’re looking to have a serious discussion on a topic, if you're sick ad tired of the same bunch of users turning every topic into a religious/political shitfest, please use the [\[R\]eddiquette flair.](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/reddiquette) We’ll make sure the trolls and hate-mongers stay away, 

**Lastly, Please Participate More:** Your votes make a difference. 

We really want to request each and every one of you to help us in keeping this subreddit a clean and civil forum for discussion. At the end of the day, /r/india is as good as the vocal participants. If you want to see a thoughtful community that is able to discuss important issues without petty squabbles, **go and Vote! Speak up** and be part of the voice. Upvote all the relevant and quality comments. Downvote irrelevant comments/posts, bigotry, name-calling and hatred filled comments.  
You don't have to limit yourselves to Random Daily Discussion or a few fun threads, just because some devious users can't make a coherent sentence without calling you names. Systematic harassment and bullying will not be tolerated on /r/India, and if you're on the receiving end of this behavior, feel free to drop us a message anytime.

We are just 10 mods spread across different timezones, and it’s very difficult to do his without community’s support. Thanks for reading and hope to see a better /r/India tomorrow!

---

**TL;DR**:  

1. Unverified Flair for posts without credible source
2. All religious posts might be flaired as *Moderated*: which is essentially R enforced.
3. Please participate more: Vote, and make your voice heard. Question bigotry and don't be intimidated by a few hatefilled users

As I have bias towards him, would love to read why his detractors feel that way.

That being said, aren't all of India's politicians solo leaders who brook ZERO intra party dissension? At least Modi had to fight his own party to stake the claim of first among equals, whereas people like a Sonia, Rahul or Jaya or Mulayam are uncontested leaders of their parties.

Take the rise of Sonia, she quelled all dissent, ruthlessly shut down eminent people like Narashima Rao, chose to operate the PM via remote control, thereby denigrating the role of the PM as the head of state who constitutionally has only the President above him, has her ""eyes & ears"" in all aspects of governance, who has despite holding all the reins of power been a reculse and has given maybe 2,3 interviews at best in 10 years. Whose son has the gumption to tear up a Cabinet ordinance and proclaim it as nonsense...how is any of this not fascist or dictatorial?

We need not even go down to the regional parties where people like Mulayam, Maya or Jaya lord it up like kings & queens.

Modi on the other hand, has had to fight his claim to be CM of Guj, has had to fight his way to be the face of the BJP, he still has his powerful detractors within the BJP.

I am being told that I am a Hindu. I am also told that my parents, relatives and the caste in which we were born and brought up are Hindu. This totally baffles me.  I, indeed not only I, but all of us, the dalitbahujans of India have never heard the word - not as a word, nor as a name of a culture nor as a name of a religion - in our childhood days. We heard about Turukoolli (Muslims), we heard about Kiristianiapoollut (Christians), we heard about Bapanoolu (Brahmins) and Konaioolli (Baniyas) spoken of as people who were different from us. Among these four categories, the most different were the Bapanoollu and the Komatoollu. There are at least some aspects of life common to us and the Turukoollu and the Kiristianapoollu. We all eat meat. We all touch each other... The only people with who we had no relations whatsoever were the Bapanoollu and the Komatoollu. But today we are suddenly being told that we have a common religious and cultural relationship with them.

Had started this sub a while back and even posted about it here. Unfortunately I couldn't get much traction and only a few people ended up joining, so I stopped working on it.

While /r/india is a decent place for most things, it's impossible nowadays to have any form of discussion here without having to wade through unfunny jokes, troll accounts, mass downvoting and all (no offense meant to anyone, including the mods). 

There's no real platform for good, India-centric, discussion. Facebook is... well, you know. Quora is an IIT/IIM circlejerk. Reddit can truly be an amazing place to have amazing conversations. Especially if proper reddiquette is followed (and maybe enforced?).

This is why I'm considering maybe putting up more effort and maybe resuming /r/debateindia. I'll need your help to get more mods, set the rules, and start it up.

1553879497.0,10,0,7,"Hello r/india! I have been living in a non-metro city for past few years and recently shifted jobs (Company A and B) and houses (House H1 and H2) both.

**Backstory:**

Concerned apartment (and other unknown businesses) is/are owned by a lady ""F"", whose husband ""M"" holds an ""Irrevocable Power of Attorney"" for all things owned/operated/etc by F. Account provided to me to transfer rent every month belongs to daughter ""D"" (no idea if it is joint account). M had sent me his HUF PAN card photo before the agreement was done.

Due to some issues, broker who showed the flat was out of picture during actual registration of agreement - which happened at sub-registrar's office and not online. M was never asked to submit his individual PAN or even present F's PAN.

All rent transfers were always online (IMPS or NEFT) from the my same account to the provided D's account.

**Actual Issue:**

From April 2017 to March 2019, I have been staying at the H1. The rent was initially little less than 14k and then after 11 months, me and my owner mutually agreed to extend the agreement (over a phone call), in which he also proposed an increase in rent of rupees 1000/-. Later, in a next call few days later, he asked me to 'pay rounded amount' as the rent which was exact 15k. I obliged to his terms all the times.

Now, when in January 2018, I had asked him for PAN, he said he'll talk to his lawyer and decide. Later, he declined giving it to me. Because I was not in any taxable slab, CA at company A only showed <1 lacs as rent paid and it was fine. This CA was not fine with M's HUF PAN as owner's PAN.

Coming to January 2019, I was confident owner would not provide PAN but still gave a call and to my surprise he said yes. He kept on prolonging actually giving it to me citing ""TDS would be cut"". I told him he's a Self Employed person, so no one is going to cut TDS from him. He still never gave it. LOL. So even for FY18-19, CA at company A used 8000/- as rent paid every month as I was still out of tax slabs (submitted original agreement copy and bank statement - was never asked to submit rent receipts, and no PAN was submitted here).

End on Jan, I switched jobs. Company B CA did not have a problem with HUF PAN and asked me to submit rent receipts with HUF PAN mentioned. Also, when I explained him the scenario, he asked me to address rent receipts to ""M"" instead of ""F"" as I had previously done.

Rent for H1 has been paid until March 2019, but I shifted to H2 (rent 22k) around mid March and paid equivalent rent there too. H2 has a registered agreement from March 2019 which allowed me to shift mid month because of an emergency.

**Important Note:**

I don't care how M or F move their money around (may be in millions, has political family and is from rural west MH).
All I care is saving my money and not paying his taxes - now that I am taxable. And not legally implicated.

**Questions:**

1. Whose PAN should actually have been provided/asked by me during registration of agreement?
2. Submitting rent receipts for first time: Legal issues for forging M's signature (for actual rent paid as he would never give signature voluntarily)?
3. Given that actual registered agreement period was over after 11 months but I was actually staying there for 13 months more and paying electricity bills and rents (all online) prove I was still a resident at the flat?

Question 3 assumes that I get IT query after owner declares signatures forged, declines I was resident or paid rent for period after agreement.

Thanks to all for your time and help.

TLDR: Verbally extended rental agreement has no PAN as owner/attorney does not wish to provide it. Forging signature on receipts for actual rent paid online every time.

1394592626.0,10,46,0,"I just noticed an /r/India mod threaten another commenter for using a personal expletive in one of the threads. The mod's threat was worded as follows:

> Can you stop with personal attacks??

> Please consider this as your first warning.

**It was not a Reddiquette enforced thread.** So, is it a general rule now that no ""personal attacks"" are allowed on /r/India on any thread? I checked the ""Rules"" in the side-bar, and there was nothing there about ""personal attacks"". There is something under the ""Requests"" which is worded thusly:

> Do read the Reddiquette and refrain from personal/vindictive attacks while commenting.

Several questions:

1. What is the difference between ""Rules"" and ""Requests""? I thought Requests are nice-to-have requests which can be ignored.

2. What constitutes a ""personal/vindictive attack""? Specifically, are the use of expletives now considered as considered as ""attacks""? What about calling someone a moron, an idiot, stupid, etc.? Where does the ""vindictive"" part figure in this?

3. Are ""personal attacks"" not allowed anywhere? Not even on non-Reddiquette enforced threads? So, no use of expletives?

4. Is ""no personal attacks"" an enforced rule or a suggested request? If it is the latter, please move it to the rules section. If it is the latter, please don't threaten people for ignoring a request.

5. Also, the request I quoted above suggests that we ""read the Reddiquette"", but nothing about following Reddiquette. Is that the intention?

/r/Kosovo will also be hosting a thread for us to ask them questions, and talk to them, right here. Feel free to go ask them stuff, you guys can flair yourselves too.

Please be civil, the event will be moderated. It goes without saying that you must respect the rules of the subreddit you are participating in, and also basic Reddiquette. This is a time to celebrate what we have in common.

Depending on the technology the max amount of bandwidth available for ""Public use"" is a fixed amount. Let's for sake of discussion, equate Bandwidth = Money. India has already shown that Socialism is a failed concept. i.e equal money to all is foolishness and gives rise to corruption and is basically, a disaster  that would take years to be recovered from. So why would it be better in case of internet? Wouldn't it be much better if more bandwidth is allocated to services that is necessary for public rather than services that are entertainment for public. Like say, wouldn't it be more beneficial if more bandwidth is provided for Hospitals, Defense, Emergency services etc, rather than say, Netflix or porn sites? Lets talk about future, suppose a service like Netflix is started in India, which becomes so famous, that almost, 50-60% of population is on Netflix on sunday, using more than 50-60% of total bandwidth available with that technology, wouldn't it decrease the bandwidth of an emergency service, or Hospital, or research lab, or defense services.

> 
> #'**Delhi' by Vandana Singh** 
(Lightspeed Magazine, 2016) [approx 7000 words] 

> Read the story here: http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/delhi/

This story, written in English, is about a man who can drift in and out of different periods of time. This temporal (i.e. time-related) travelling takes him through different historical periods of the city of Delhi, as it was under different emperors and rulers. 

For our first time with this reading group, I wanted to pick a story by one of my favourite speculative fiction authors from India - Vandana Singh. She was born and brought up in India, and she now teaches physics at an American university- though her stories, written in English and Hindi, are mostly science fiction and fantasy drawing from life in India. You can read more about her at her [website](http://vandana-writes.com/about-vandana/) or on Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandana_Singh). She recently published a short story collection called [Ambiguity Machines and Other Stories](https://zubaanbooks.com/shop/ambiguity-machines/) (Zubaan Books), but this story is from an earlier anthology of science fiction called '[So Long Been Dreaming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/847409.So_Long_Been_Dreaming)'.

The rules are simple - read the story and tell us what you thought about it in the comments. If you haven't read the story yet, I'd suggest you stay away from the comments as people's comments may contain spoilers! Please observe reddiquette - be polite and respectful.

Over the last few years we have seen a steady growth of subscribers. This has brought in great participation and some unpleasant behavior. To combat the latter, we have implemented a detailed set of rules and added members to our team to help enforce them. This has resulted in a much better place to discuss ideas without being threatened physical harm.
 
However, this still gives a few people room to circumvent rules and indulge in low-effort comments that meant purely to rile other users or to insult people of a certain religion or political belief. So going forward, we'd like to elevate the state of discussions on this sub.
 
For the next 3 weeks, as an experiment, **all** political and Religious threads will be [Rediquette enforced](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/reddiquette) by default. We Indians love to talk about politics and no one can take that away from us. What we do ask is that people put a little more thought into what they say, so that /r/india is a little better place to talk than the rabid comments section of the Times Of India. Incidentally, this was one of the changes requested in the feedback thread by a few people.
 
What will be blocked in the comments
 
* Slurs
 
* Invectives such as ""seculars/sanghis/bhakts/*tards/communal"" - this list is not complete, but serves as an example. Armchair lawyers trying to circumvent this, please don't take this as a challenge but understand where we come from and cooperate.
 
* Low-effort comments such as ""Lol what can you expect from these fascists/rightwingers/leftists"". Make a point, but put some thought into it.
 
 
What will still be allowed in the comments (as long as they don't belong to the categories above)
 
* Sarcasm, jokes and humor - make jokes about apparel all you want, just put some effort into it
 
* Memes
 
 
Quite simply put, we're trying to enforce the [No Asshole rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No_Asshole_Rule). If this trial period succeeds, we will make the changes permanent.

You can help us out by reporting comments that do not belong to political threads.
 
Thank you for your participation and we look forward to building a better community and dream of a 24 hour period where we won't be asked to fornicate ourselves.",,[R]Political Threads - A new way forward,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2rv4tw/rpolitical_threads_a_new_way_forward/
1494883276.0,10,133,107,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",,We really need to talk about Flairs.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/

The forum has gone through so many changes in the last year. We have grown from a small community of 3000 subs to close to 6000 subs within 8 months. 

Reddit as a community has contributed to many positive changes in the US. Look at what kleinbl00 did for youngluck, or look at communities like r/favors, r/assistance, r/randomactsofpizza and their likes. 

I'm not asking or even suggesting that r/india to do something on that level. All I'm asking for is civility in discussions and to users to stop abusing each other. 

From a community that was robust in its discussions, we have devolved into a community of name calling, hatred, trolling and religious hatred. Debates are healthy and enrich the knowledge of everyone involved if done in the right manner. But here the only response seems to insulting each other and their family members

The experiment of banning users was something that I myself was not convinced on. But I didn't have the foresight to see the limitations of it and couldn't find an another acceptable way of maintaining civility in the forum. After discussing with the new mods, we decided to implement it as they were in agreement. 

What followed was something everyone knows. I will honestly accept my mistake of banning sniperinthebushes and apologise for it. My fellow mods ensured that it was reversed and I immediately realized what I had done and unbanned him. It was purely an emotional moment when I was called names and I acted on that. I have learnt much from that episode personally and have ensured that internet abuse does not affect me anymore.

I believe that r/india as a community will not stop growing and if this uncivil behaviour continues, we may end up attracting the wrong attention towards us and the community may suffer for it. 

Now that dirtyd0ggy has gone, can we, as a community, move on to making r/india a positive forum for discussion? 

I humbly request each and every one of you and the troll brigade to please, stop the religion bashing and hatred and abuse [also the ascii goatses] and the incessant downvoting. 

Let us make r/india as an example of what goodness we are capable of from our country.

1400439278.0,10,35,7,"I made some obviously controversial statements that set many a knicker ablaze, didn't want to go about responding to each and every one of these individually, and also thought it would be good to have fresh thread talking from the non Israeli Pov.

Before I start - seriously, I now understand how it feels to be at the receiving end of my right wing brethren, I have been called an anti-Semite (how, questioning a country's policies and it's government makes me an anti anything is beyond me), weed smoking hippie, delusional Palestinian apologist amongst other stuff, my question to you folks who insist on needless ad-hominem is this, 

Can't one have a view which is contrarian to yours? Must everybody see the world only from your prism? Why needless ad-hominem? Everybody can indulge in it, but what would be the outcome? We would only be slinging insults at each other which mean nothing in real life and civil discourse is given the go by.

Once more onto the breech!!! but before I substantiate the claims I had made, some commonly repeated lines of reasoning need to be rebutted.

**Israel is surrounded by enemies & it's very survival is in question, so it has the right to do whatever it feels like doing**

* This was true in 47, this was true in 67 (which is where the seeds of the current conflicts were sown), but it is absolutely not true in 2014 (or not for the past 25-30 years at the least).

* It's major opposition has been completely neutralised - Egypt? It has a peace accord which both have respected, likewise Jordan, Iraq is out of the equation, Iran's nuclear plans have been neutralised and while on paper it remains a credible threat, the reality is that the whole world knows, if Iran even makes a hint of a hostile move in this region against any country, let alone Israel, it will feel the full impact of the US military (and maybe NATO as a whole)...so Iran is clearly not a threat. That leaves us states like Lebanon (which has it's own problems, largely caused by Israeli policies, and has shown that left to it's own tends to gravitate towards a fairly tolerant model).

* In terms of defence budgets, in terms of quality of manpower, training, equipment (all Uncle Sam's blessings mostly) the IDF is far and away miles ahead of it's closest competitors, so this whole ""Israel under siege"" nonsense needs to be put to rest.

**Israel is this utopia for Israeli Arabs**

* At the outset, one cannot but be blind to the fact that Israeli arabs have far more rights in Israel than in any other major Islamic country, only a fool will deny it, but it still has some serious questions raised on how Israeli arabs are treated as second class citizens with serious cries of even an almost apartheid like state in many areas and there are moves to constitutionalise this in the form of the [Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_proposal:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People), [some more on this](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/04/binyamin-netanyahu-israel-jewish-state).

Historically this goes against what it's founder David Ben Gurion wanted - he wanted (and had his way when the constitution of Israel was framed) Arabs to be treated equally, and no discrimination at all to be practiced. At the time Israel was formed, he went all out to assure Arabs that they will be treated well in Israel and requested Arab's to stay back in their villages and homes. Now in a classic case of fear mongering (similar to the one in India), Muslim leaders warned of a genocide of Arab's & Muslims and succeeded in winning over their people and thus began a massive exodus.

This hawkish stance of Israel in recent times is what I as an observer of that region deride - if when truly surrounded by enemies, Israel could afford to be magnanimous, what is the need now to disenfranchise Arabs? How different (in spirit if not in actual themes) is this different from the [Nuremberg laws?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws)

How can, *Arabs are second class citizens in Israel, but are better off than in other Arab countries ever be an excuse for this discrimination*? Is Tu quoque ever a solution? When a country like Israel with it's history of treating Muslims, Arabs well (Israeli) over time becomes exceedingly hawkish and discriminatory, does it not require wide condemnation? 


Now, to address the points I had made.

**Israel consistently violates agreement's it has signed or agreed to sign in negotiations with the PLO / Palestinian Arabs**

A couple of Wiki links on stuff like this alone will not suffice, they barely even scratch the surface of the reality that is Israel's duplicituous and perfidious stance when it comes to dealing with the Palestinians.

Let me as an example address Madrid. /u/pbdirigible says no agreement was signed in Madrid as that is what Wiki will tell you.

Reality went like this,

* As a precondition to Madrid, Israel wanted a UN resolution - resolution # 3379 struck off it's books (revoked), the US and the Arabs agreed to this and it was done.

* Yizhtak Shamir then wanted an unconditional loan guarantee of $ 10 billion from the US (which was later given without any fuss to the next Israeli regime to form the government), but the Bush proposal of wanting specific guarantees from Israel on troop reduction from the occupied territories was outright rejected. Bush stood firm on this, and Shamir had to back down.

* Then came the new effort at stalling the process - Shamir and Israel outright rejected PLO negotiators (though PLO was as per the previous resolution 3379 granted observer status and was the defacto political entity representing the Palestinians), he got his way.

* Then Israel played it's final trump card - Madrid won't see any Israeli negotiation, but it will broadly agree on the items to be negotiated (troop withdrawals, and Israeli withdrawal from the illegally occupied territories). These two items had been a condition of the ceasefire after the Yom Kippur war - [Resolution 242](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242) and [Resolution 338](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242), the Palestinians (secretly operating on behalf of the PLO) agreed. By this time Shamir had lost the elections (he was seen as too hawkish even by the Israeli's) and Rabin had come to power - he said **Israel WILL HONOUR it's commitments, and slowly start phased troop withdrawals and got the $ 10 BN loan**...and then promptly Israel went back on it's words. It did hold 5 other parleys, in which they stalled the entire process (Palestinian demands were simple, do what Israel has repeatedly promised to do) till it collapsed without anything emerging from it.

This level of duplicity was then seen in Oslo, to go into that at length would mean too much of a digression, but suffice to say that Israel played the same game of making promises (This time in an accord, so no disputing it) and then promptly going back on them. From the previous parleys and UN resolutions, Israel forced Arafat to something called three tier zones - in which Palestinian self governance was recognised ONLY in Zone A which was a very truncated area, this buried all Israeli promises, UN resolutions, Security council resolutions finally - of course, now, they are encroaching onto even zone A.

I will keep adding to this post as it is taking me time to draft these. I hope that my rabid right winger bretheren cool down on the ad-hominem, don't call me a pot smoking hippie who pulls stuff from his arse and respond with facts, figures and opinions formed out of those.

Interestingly enough, I was also a hard core Israel supporter till 5-6 years ago, when a lot of reading from the Palestinian perspective gave me a whole lot to think about.

Some must read to get a balanced perspective (if you are interested in a balanced perspective that is)

* [The Great War for Civilisation by Robert Fisk](http://www.amazon.in/The-Great-War-Civilisation-Conquest/dp/1400075173) - This is a MUST READ for anybody interested in understanding the politics in the Middle East

* [Lords of the Land](http://www.amazon.in/Lords-Land-Settlements-Occupied-Territories/dp/1568584148/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400410129&sr=1-1&keywords=Lords+of+the+Land%3A+The+War+Over+Israel%27s+Settlements+in+the+Occupied+..) - the paperback is atrociously expensive, but most uni libraries stock it, or the Kindle version is only Rs 500 or so.

* The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A History by Ian Bickerton - provides some solid insight into the roots of the conflict. I paired this with some fictional work by Leon Uris, gave me a good flavour for the period.

* Fictional works by Leon Uris (just for the flavour, he does some solid research)

* Israel the West Bank and International Law - The definitive work on the legal aspects (various UN resolutions, the whole legality of the Israeli occupation etc), a little dry, but interesting if you can break through the whole dry style.

Note - I have referenced Wiki as a starting point, but my main citations would be from the books I have referred, though please don't expect me to start quoting page numbers - I am not quoting directly from these (and other books I have not mentioned here), but my ideas and opinions were framed by these.
